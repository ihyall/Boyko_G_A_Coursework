Nonassociative and associative modification of head-waving produced by aversive tentacular stimuli in Aplysia.,Learning & Memory,Learn. Mem.,1072-0502,1549-5485,10.1101/lm.3.5.366,http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/3/5/366,3,5,01/01/1997,366,375,"['K K Fitzgerald', 'C A Takacs', 'T J Carew']","['Department of Psychology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.']","Head-waving, a spontaneously occurring exploratory and appetitive behavior of the marine mollusc Aplysia, provides an opportunity to examine mechanisms of learning expressed in a nonreflexive behavior. The present study explores nonassociative and associative forms of learned modification of head-waving produced using an aversive stimulus as reinforcement. Experiments on intact, freely behaving animals demonstrate that training with electric shock as an aversive unconditioned stimulus, delivered unilaterally to the anterior tentacles, produces a learned shift in head-waving behavior away from the side on which shock was applied. This behavioral change is a novel learned behavioral response that is influenced by the topographic location of an aversive stimulus. Furthermore, training with application of tentacle shock reinforcement, contingent upon the animal's head position, produces operant conditioning of head-waving. Thus, anterior tentacle shock is effective as an aversive reinforcer for both nonassociative and operant learning expressed in the head-waving behavior of Aplysia."
A sulfate pocket formed by three GoU pairs in the 0.97 A resolution X-ray structure of a nonameric RNA.,RNA,RNA,1355-8382,1469-9001,,http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/5/10/1384,5,10,10/01/1999,1384,1395,"['B Masquida', 'C Sauter', 'E Westhof']","['Institut de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire--Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UPR 9002 Structure des Macromolécules Biologiques et Mécanismes de Reconnaissance, Strasbourg, France.']","The crystal structure of the RNA duplex [r(CGUGAUCG)dC]2 has been solved at a resolution of 0.97 A. The model has been refined to R-work and R-free of 14.88% and 19.54% for 23,838 independent reflections. The base-pairing scheme forces the 5'-rC to be excluded from the helix and to be disordered. In the crystals, the sequence promotes the formation of two GoU wobble pairs that cluster around a crystallographic threefold axis in two different ways. In the first contact type, the GoU pairs are exclusively surrounded by water molecules, whereas in the other contact type, the three amino groups of the guanine residues of the symmetry-related GoU pairs trap a sulfate ion. This work provides the first example of the interaction of a GoU pair with a sulfate ion in a helical context. Despite the negative charge on the polynucleotide backbone, the guanine amino N2 is able to attract negatively charged groups that could, in the folding of complex RNA molecules, belong to a negative phosphodiester group from a neighboring strand and, in a RNA-protein complex, to a negative carboxyl group of an aspartate or glutamate side chain."
Exon skipping in genes encoding lineage-defining myogenic transcription factors in rhabdomyosarcoma,Molecular Case Studies,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud,,2373-2873,10.1101/mcs.a006190,http://molecularcasestudies.cshlp.org/content/8/5/a006190,8,5,08/01/2022,a006190,,"['Erin Butler', 'Lin Xu', 'Dinesh Rakheja', 'Blake Schwettmann', 'Shireen Toubbeh', 'Lei Guo', 'Jiwoong Kim', 'Stephen X.

To explore potential defects in the differentiation program, we searched for mRNA splicing variants in genes encoding transcription factors driving skeletal muscle lineage commitment and differentiation. We studied two RMS cases and identified altered splicing resulting in “skipping” the second of three exons in MYOD1 . RNA-seq data from 42 tumors and additional RMS cell lines revealed exon 2 skipping in both MYOD1 and MYF5 but not in MYF6 or MYOG . Complementary molecular analysis of MYOD1 mRNA found evidence for exon skipping in five additional RMS cases. Functional studies showed that so-called MYODΔEx2 protein failed to robustly induce muscle-specific genes, and its ectopic expression conferred a selective advantage in cultured fibroblasts and an RMS xenograft. In summary, we present previously unrecognized exon skipping within MYOD1 and MYF5 in RMS, and we propose that alternative splicing can represent a mechanism to alter the function of these two transcription factors in RMS."
In vitro selection identifies key determinants for loop-loop interactions: RNA aptamers selective for the TAR RNA element of HIV-1.,RNA,RNA,1355-8382,1469-9001,,http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/5/12/1605,5,12,12/01/1999,1605,1614,"['F Ducongé', 'J J Toulmé']","['Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale U 386, IFR Pathologies Infectieuses, Université Victor Segalen, Bordeaux, France.']","We selected RNA aptamers specific for the trans-activation responsive (TAR) RNA, a stem-loop structure crucial for the transcription of the integrated genome of the human immunodeficiency virus. Most of the selected sequences could be folded as imperfect hairpins and displayed a 5'-GUCCCAGA-3' consensus motif constituting the apical loop. The six central bases of this consensus sequence are complementary to the entire TAR loop, leading to the formation of TAR RNA-aptamer ""kissing"" complexes. The consensus G and A residues closing the aptamer loop contributed to the high affinity (Kd = 30 nM at 23 degrees C) of the aptamers for the TAR RNA. This G A pair was shown to be crucial for binding to TAR at a low magnesium concentration. The selection also identified 5'-PuPy and 5'-PyPu base pairs at alpha and beta positions of the stem, next to the loop, respectively. This strategy offered a way to identify key determinants of loop-loop interactions and to generate high affinity ligands of TAR RNA structure."

Embryonic development in E. scolopes is robust over a range of temperatures, is relatively rapid (~21 d), and proceeds normally under laboratory conditions at ambient temperature (27°C-29°C).

We focus on evidence for the involvement of various second messengers and their effectors as well as the biochemical strategies employed in each phase to convert a transient signal into a lasting change in the neuron. We also consider, from a biochemical perspective, the implications of a multiphase model for LTP."
An autonomous kinase generated during long-term facilitation in Aplysia is related to the Ca(2+)-independent protein kinase C Apl II.,Learning & Memory,Learn.

We have shown previously that there is a protein synthesis-dependent increase in an autonomous kinase activity that phosphorylates a protein kinase C substrate during an intermediate phase of this facilitation. Here, I report that the increase in autonomous activity was independent of RNA synthesis, suggesting it may play a role in the maintenance phase of synaptic facilitation. Immunoprecipitation experiments using an antibody specific to the Ca(2+)-independent protein kinase C, Apl II, demonstrated that the autonomous kinase activity increased by serotonin emanated from Apl II. Chelerythrine, an inhibitor targeted to the substrate binding site of protein kinase C, also blocked the autonomous kinase activity increased by serotonin. Using immunoblotting experiments and calphostin-C, an inhibitor targeted to the regulatory domain of protein kinase C, the autonomous activity is shown not to be a catalytic fragment of Apl II. Furthermore, a higher concentration of calphostin-C was required to inhibit autonomous kinase activity than regulated kinase activity, suggesting that calphostin-C's binding site in the regulatory domain of Apl II is modified in the autonomous kinase. These data suggest that an autonomous kinase derived from Apl II may play a role in synaptic facilitation in Aplysia."

CRPC-NE therefore retains early prostate cancer genomic alterations and acquires new molecular changes making them resistant to traditional CRPC therapies. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of CRPC-NE biology, the transdifferentiation/plasticity process, and development and characterization of relevant CRPC-NE preclinical models."

In particular, we show that the late-training deficit found in Knowlton, Squire, and Gluck's 1994 study of amnesic category learning can be understood as a natural consequence of Gluck and Myers's (1993) theory of hippocampal-region function, a theory that has heretofore been applied only to studies of animal learning. When applied to Knowlton et al.'s category learning task, Gluck and Myers's model assumes that the hippocampal region induces new stimulus representations over multiple training trials that reflect stimulus-stimulus regularities in the training set. As such, the model expects an advantage for control subjects over hippocampal-damaged amnesic patients only later in training when control subjects have developed new hippocampal-dependent stimulus representations; in contrast, both groups are expected to show equivalent performance early in training. A potentially analogous early/late distinction is described for animal studies of stimulus generalization. Our analyses suggest that careful comparisons between early and late-training differences in learning may be an important factor in understanding amnesia and the neural bases of both animal and human learning."
Higher-order associative processing in Hermissenda suggests multiple sites of neuronal modulation.,Learning & Memory,Learn.

Here, we examined the process of blocking, thought by some to reflect a cognitive aspect of classical conditioning, and its underlying mechanisms in the marine mollusc Hermissenda. In two behavioral experiments, a context defined by chemosensory stimuli was made excitatory by presenting unsignalled USs (rotation) in that context. The excitatory context subsequently blocked overt learning about a discrete conditioned stimulus (CS; light) paired with the US in that context. In a third experiment, the excitability of the B photoreceptors in the Hermissenda eye, which typically increases following light-rotation pairings, was examined in behaviorally blocked animals, as well as in animals that had acquired a normal CS-US association or animals that had been exposed to the CS and US unpaired. Both the behaviorally blocked and the ""normal"" learning groups exhibited increases in neuronal excitability relative to unpaired animals. However, light-induced multiunit activity in pedal nerves was suppressed following normal conditioning but not in blocked or unpaired control animals, suggesting that the expression of blocking is mediated by neuronal modifications not directly reflected in B-cell excitability, possibly within an extensive network of central light-responsive interneurons."

Although precision medicine makes use of various types of data, this piece focuses on molecular characterization data specifically, as the discoveries yielded from these data can advance thinking around clinical care for cancer patients. Our pediatrics genomics team at the University of California Santa Cruz Genomics Institute is uniquely situated to discuss the use of shared genomic data for clinical benefit because our collaborations with hospital partners in the United States and internationally rely on big-data comparative genomic analysis. Using shared data, Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative develops methods for comparative analysis of tumor RNA sequencing profiles from single patients for the purposes of identifying overexpressed oncogenes that could be targeted by therapies in the clinic. To enable and improve this analysis, we continuously increase the size of our data compendium by adding public pediatric tumor RNA sequencing data sets. We developed an approach for assessing the quality of shared RNA sequencing data to ensure the integrity of the data. In this approach we calculate the number of mapped exonic nonduplicate (MEND) reads, applying a 10 million MEND read minimum threshold for inclusion in our comparative analysis. In collaboration with Stanford University and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, our team at Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative explores the value to researchers everywhere of shared genomic data for clinical utility and the challenges of data sharing that threaten to impede otherwise rapid advances in precision medicine.

In principle, a protein-specific antibody is used to purify the protein of choice and its associated complex members from worm extract. This may also include RNA molecules associated with other protein components. To identify a specific mRNA molecule, all RNA molecules are first separated from the protein components after immunopurification. The mRNAs are then converted into cDNA by reverse transcription. Candidate mRNAs are detected by sensitive gene-specific amplification via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a semiquantitative manner. Since RNA molecules are very prone to degradation, it is crucial to avoid any kind of contamination with RNase activity in this experiment."

Bt brinjal provides essentially complete control of EFSB, dramatically reduces insecticide sprays, provides a sixfold increase in grower profit, and does not affect nontarget arthropod biodiversity. A major focus is to ensure its durability through stewardship. Bangladesh has shown great leadership in adopting biotechnology for the benefit of its farmers and serves as an example for other countries."
PUF60: a novel U2AF65-related splicing activity.,RNA,RNA,1355-8382,1469-9001,,http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/5/12/1548,5,12,12/01/1999,1548,1560,"['P S Page-McCaw', 'K Amonlirdviman', 'P A Sharp']","['Center for Cancer Research and Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139, USA.']","We have identified a new pyrimidine-tract binding factor, PUF, that is required, together with U2AF, for efficient reconstitution of RNA splicing in vitro. The activity has been purified and consists of two proteins, PUF60 and the previously described splicing factor p54. p54 and PUF60 form a stable complex in vitro when cotranslated in a reaction mixture. PUF activity, in conjunction with U2AF, facilitates the association of U2 snRNP with the pre-mRNA. This reaction is dependent upon the presence of the large subunit of U2AF, U2AF65, but not the small subunit U2AF35. PUF60 is homologous to both U2AF65 and the yeast splicing factor Mud2p. The C-terminal domain of PUF60, the PUMP domain, is distantly related to the RNA-recognition motif domain, and is probably important in protein-protein interactions."

If possible, obtain sequence for the marsupial protein to see which regions of the protein are the most highly conserved between marsupials and eutherians. When purchasing an antibody, if possible, choose one that has shown reactivity across a broad range of species, and preferably choose a polyclonal rather than a monoclonal. Because a tammar epitope may differ slightly from the one against which an antibody was raised, it may be affected differently by fixation, especially if fixatives (such as paraformaldehyde [PFA] or formalin) that cross-link proteins are used. When testing a new antibody on tammar tissues, we therefore routinely test numerous pretreatments to see which one gives optimal staining. In some cases, the optimal pretreatment differs from that suggested by the manufacturer of the antibody. This protocol describes how to use the avidin-biotin complex detection method on paraffin-embedded specimens."

To overcome this difficulty, we have exclusively applied dye terminators in combination with a thermostable ""sequenase"" for shotgun sequencing GC-rich cosmids from pNGR234a, the 500-kbp symbiotic replicon of Rhizobium sp. NGR234. A thermostable sequenase incorporates dye terminators into DNA more efficiently than Taq DNA polymerase, thus reducing the concentrations needed (20- to 250-fold). Unincorporated dye terminators can simply be removed by ethanol precipitation. Here, we present data of pXB296, one of 23 overlapping cosmids representing pNGR234a. We demonstrate that the greatly reduced number of compressions results in a much faster assembly of cosmid sequence data by comparing assembly of the shotgun data from pXB296 and the data from another pNGR234a cosmid (pXB110) sequenced using dye primer methods. Within the 34,010-bp sequence from pXB296, 28 coding regions were predicted.

It influences the properties of molecules by modifying the reactivity and solubility of the corresponding aglycones, so influencing cellular localization and bioactivity. Glycosylation of plant natural products is usually carried out by uridine diphosphate(UDP)-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs) belonging to the carbohydrate-active enzyme glycosyltransferase 1 (GT1) family. These enzymes transfer sugars from UDP-activated sugar moieties to small hydrophobic acceptor molecules. Plant GT1s generally show high specificity for their sugar donors and recognize a single UDP sugar as their substrate. In contrast, they are generally promiscuous with regard to acceptors, making them attractive biotechnological tools for small molecule glycodiversification. Although microbial hosts have traditionally been used for heterologous engineering of plant-derived glycosides, transient plant expression technology offers a potentially disruptive platform for rapid characterization of new plant glycosyltransferases and biosynthesis of complex glycosides."

To better understand these interactions, U33-substituted yeast tRNA(Phe) anticodon stem and loop domains (ASLs) were used as probes of anticodon orientation on the ribosome. Orientation of the anticodon in the ribosomal P-site was assessed with a quantitative chemical footprinting method in which protection constants (Kp) quantify protection afforded to individual 16S rRNA P-site nucleosides by tRNA or synthetic ASLs. Chemical footprints of native yeast tRNA(Phe), ASL-U33, as well as ASLs containing 3-methyluridine, cytidine, or deoxyuridine at position 33 (ASL-m3U33, ASL-C33, and ASL-dU33, respectively) were compared. Yeast tRNAPhe and the ASL-U33 protected individual 16S rRNA P-site nucleosides differentially. Ribosomal binding of yeast tRNA(Phe) enhanced protection of C1400, but the ASL-U33 and U33-substituted ASLs did not. Two residues, G926 and G1338 with KpS approximately 50-60 nM, were afforded significantly greater protection by both yeast tRNA(Phe) and the ASL-U33 than other residues, such as A532, A794, C795, and A1339 (KpS approximately 100-200 nM). In contrast, protections of G926 and G1338 were greatly and differentially reduced in quantitative footprints of U33-substituted ASLs as compared with that of the ASL-U33. ASL-m3U33 and ASL-C33 protected G530, A532, A794, C795, and A1339 as well as the ASL-U33. However, protection of G926 and G1338 (KpS between 70 and 340 nM) was significantly reduced in comparison to that of the ASL-U33 (43 and 61 nM, respectively). Though protections of all P-site nucleosides by ASL-dU33 were reduced as compared to that of the ASL-U33, a proportionally greater reduction of G926 and G1338 protections was observed (KpS = 242 and 347 nM, respectively). Thus, G926 and G1338 are important to efficient P-site binding of tRNA. More importantly, when tRNA is bound in the ribosomal P-site, G926 and G1338 of 16S rRNA and the invariant U33 of tRNA are positioned close to each other."

Furthermore, the two Fugu genes are linked tandemly in a head-to-tail array similar to their human homologs with 2.2 kb of intergenic sequence. Amino acid sequences of the Fugu and human PDGFR beta and CSFIR genes show an overall homology of 45% and 39%, respectively, with the kinase domains showing a much higher degree of conservation. Dot-matrix analysis revealed several short stretches of conserved sequences in the 3' untranslated regions of the PDGFR beta genes and the adjacent promoter regions of the CSFIR genes. These conserved sequences may have a role in the regulation of expression of either or both of these closely linked genes."

Taste neurons are broadly divided into subpopulations associated with either positive or negative behavioral valence, each expressing combinations of taste receptors—in some cases, more than 30 receptors—encoded by one or more chemosensory gene families that together determine their chemical response properties. Drosophila provides a powerful model to study gustatory coding because a majority of the taste sensory units (sensilla) are present in external taste organs (labellum and legs) and are accessible for electrophysiological analysis of tastant-evoked responses. Moreover, a large body of work on the basic characteristics of individual taste neurons housed in a sensillum, as well as on functional surveys of entire taste organs, provides a foundation for investigating further questions about taste coding, adaptability, and evolution.

One of the yeast ORFs (YBL024w) was amplified by PCR, inserted in the expression vector pET28b, and the corresponding protein was hyperexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The resulting N-terminally His6-tagged recombinant Ybl024p was purified to apparent homogeneity by one-step affinity chromatography on Ni2+-NTA-agarose column. The activity and substrate specificity of the purified Ybl024p were tested in vitro using T7 transcripts of different yeast tRNAs as substrates and S-adenosyl-L-methionine as a donor of the methyl groups. The results indicate that yeast ORF YBL024w encodes S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent tRNA: m5C-methyltransferase that is capable of methylating cytosine to m5C at several positions in different yeast tRNAs and pre-tRNAs containing intron. Modification of tRNA occurs at all four positions (34, 40, 48, and 49) at which m5C has been found in yeast tRNAs sequenced so far. Disruption of the ORF YBL024w leads to the complete absence of m5C in total yeast tRNA. Moreover no tRNA:m5C-methyltransferase activity towards all potential m5C methylation sites was detected in the extract of the disrupted yeast strain. These results demonstrate that the protein product of a single gene is responsible for complete m5C methylation of yeast tRNA. Because this newly characterized multisite-specific modification enzyme Ybl024p is the fourth tRNA-specific methyltransferase identified in yeast, we suggest designating it as TRM4, the gene corresponding to ORF YBL024w."

In one set of experiments, decerebrate ferrets were trained in a Pavlovian eye-blink conditioning paradigm with electrical forelimb train stimulation as conditioned stimulus and electrical periorbital stimulation as the unconditioned stimulus. When stable conditioning had been achieved, the effect of increasing the intensity or frequency of the forelimb stimulation was tested. By increasing the intensity from 1 to 2 mA, or the train frequency from 50 to 100 Hz, an immediate decrease was induced in both the onset latency and the latency to peak of the conditioned response. If the conditioned stimulus intensity/frequency was maintained at the higher level, the response latencies gradually returned to preshift values. In a second set of experiments, the forelimb stimulation was replaced by direct train stimulation of the middle cerebellar peduncle as conditioned stimulus. Varying the frequency of the stimulus train between 50 and 100 Hz had effects that were almost identical to those obtained when using a forelimb conditioned stimulus. The functional meaning of the latency effect is discussed. It is also suggested that the results support the view that the conditioned stimulus is transmitted through the mossy fibers and that the mechanism for timing the conditioned response is situated in the cerebellum."

MCM1 shows DNA-binding specificities similar to those of two previously reported DNA-binding factors, pheromone/receptor transcription factor (PRTF) and general regulator of mating type (GRM); like PRTF, its activity can be modulated by the alpha 1 protein. MCM1 binds to the dyad symmetry element 5'-CCTAATTAGG and related sequences, which we refer to as MCM1 control elements (MCEs). MCEs are found within the regulatory regions of a- and alpha-specific genes. Direct and indirect DNA binding assays suggest that a conserved 5'-ATTAGG in one-half of the dyad symmetry element is important for MCM1 binding whereas variants in the other half are tolerated. We have used a novel DNase I 'nicking interference' assay to investigate the interaction of MCM1 with its substrate. These data suggest that MCM1 binds as a dimer, interacting symmetrically with the ATTAGG residues in each half of the binding site. MCM1 contains striking homology to the DNA-binding domain of the human serum response factor (SRF) which mediates the transient transcriptional activation of growth-stimulated genes by binding to the serum response element (SRE). We have shown that MCM1 binds to the human c-fos SRE in vitro and, like other MCEs, the c-fos SRE exhibits MCM1-mediated upstream activating sequence (UAS) activity in vivo."

Most PIWI proteins possess piRNA-guided endonuclease activity, which is critical for silencing transposons and producing new piRNAs. Gametocyte-specific factor 1 (Gtsf1), an evolutionarily conserved zinc finger protein, promotes catalysis by PIWI proteins. Many animals have multiple Gtsf1 paralogs; however, their respective roles in the piRNA pathway are not fully understood. Here, we dissected the roles of Gtsf1 and its paralog Gtsf1-like (Gtsf1L) in the silkworm piRNA pathway. We found that Gtsf1 and Gtsf1L preferentially bind the two silkworm PIWI paralogs, Siwi and BmAgo3, respectively, and facilitate the endonuclease activity of each PIWI protein. This orthogonal activation effect was further supported by specific reduction of BmAgo3-bound Masculinizer piRNA and Siwi-bound Feminizer piRNA, the unique piRNA pair required for silkworm feminization, upon depletion of Gtsf1 and Gtsf1L, respectively. Our results indicate that the two Gtsf paralogs in silkworms activate their respective PIWI partners, thereby facilitating the amplification of piRNAs."

We describe the clinical, anatomical, and pathological features of a patient who developed corticobasal syndrome (CBS)/progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) overlap. The patient presented with progressive speech difficulties and later developed an asymmetric akinetic–rigid syndrome. Neuroimaging showed asymmetrical frontal atrophy, predominantly affecting the right side. There was a strong family history of neurodegenerative disease with four out of seven siblings developing either dementia or ALS in their 50s and 60s. The patient died at the age of 71 and the brain was donated for postmortem analysis. Histopathological examination showed frontotemporal lobar degeneration TDP-43 type A pathology. Genetic screening did not reveal a mutation in the GRN , MAPT , or C9orf72 genes, but exome sequencing revealed a novel p.E703X mutation in the TBK1 gene. Although segregation data were not available, this loss-of-function mutation is highly likely to be pathogenic because it is predicted to disrupt TBK1/optineurin interaction and impair cellular autophagy. In conclusion, we show that TBK1 mutations can be a cause of an atypical parkinsonian syndrome and screening should be considered in CBS patients with a family history of dementia or ALS."

These RNA elements (about 450 nt) contain extensive secondary structure including a hairpin loop with a conserved GNRA motif. Such loops are important in RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions. Plasmids that express dicistronic mRNAs of the structure GUS/IRES/HOOK have been constructed. The HOOK sequence encodes a cell-surface-targeted protein (sFv); the translation of this open reading frame within mammalian cells from these dicistronic mRNAs requires a functional IRES element. Cells that express the sFv can be selected from nonexpressing cells. A pool of up to 256 mutant encephalomyocarditis virus IRES elements was generated by converting the wild-type hairpin loop sequence (GCGA) to NNNN. Following transfection of this pool of mutants into COS-7 cells, plasmids were recovered from selected sFv-expressing cells. These DNAs were amplified in Escherichia coli and transfected again into COS-7 cells for further cycles to enrich for plasmids encoding functional IRES elements. The sequence of individual selected IRES elements was determined. All functional IRES elements had a tetraloop with a 3' terminal A residue. Optimal IRES activity, assayed in vitro and within cells, was obtained from plasmids encoding an IRES with the hairpin loop sequence fitting a RNRA consensus. In contrast, IRES elements containing YCYA tetraloops were severely defective."

Expression in fetal liver and blood is copy number dependent and at levels comparable to that of the endogenous mouse alpha-globin genes. Transgenic fetuses with high-copy numbers of the transgene suffer severe anemia and die before birth. Using a construct with both the human alpha- and beta-globin genes and the beta-globin DCR, live mice with low-copy numbers were obtained. Both human globin genes are expressed at high levels in adult red cells to give human hemoglobin HbA in amounts equal to or greater than endogenous mouse hemoglobin. Expression of HbA in murine red cells is not accompanied by any increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) or mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). However, these transgenic mice tend to have an increased number of reticulocytes in peripheral blood; consistent with some degree of hemolysis. Metabolic labeling experiments showed balanced mouse globin synthesis, but imbalanced human globin synthesis, with an alpha/beta biosynthetic ratio of approximately 0.6. Thus, these mice have mild anemia. These results are discussed with relation to the coordinate regulation of alpha- and beta-globin synthesis in erythroid tissues."
Impaired capacity of cerebellar patients to perceive and learn two-dimensional shapes based on kinesthetic cues.,Learning & Memory,Learn.

Patients with cerebellar lesions and age-matched healthy controls were tested on four tasks: (1) learning to discriminate a reference shape from three others through the repeated tracing of the reference template; (2) reproducing the reference shape from memory by drawing blindfolded; (3) performing the same task with vision; and (4) visually recognizing the reference shape. The cues used to acquire and then to recognize the reference shape were generated under four conditions: (1) ""active kinesthesia,"" in which cues were acquired by the blindfolded subject while actively tracing a reference template; (2) ""passive kinesthesia,"" in which the tracing was performed while the hand was guided passively through the template; (3) ""sequential vision,"" in which the shape was visualized by the serial exposure of small segments of its outline; and (4) ""full vision,"" in which the entire shape was visualized. The sequential vision condition was employed to emulate the sequential way in which kinesthetic information is acquired while tracing the reference shape. The results demonstrate a substantial impairment of cerebellar patients in their capability to perceive two-dimensional irregular shapes based only on kinesthetic cues. There also is evidence that this deficit in part relates to a reduced capacity to integrate temporal sequences of sensory cues into a complete image useful for shape discrimination tasks or for reproducing the shape through drawing. Consequently, the cerebellum has an important role in this type of sensory information processing even when it is not directly associated with the execution of movements."
cappuccino and spire: two unique maternal-effect loci required for both the anteroposterior and dorsoventral patterns of the Drosophila embryo.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.9.1437,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/9/1437,3,9,09/01/1989,1437,1452,"['L J Manseau', 'T Schüpbach']","['Department of Biology, Princeton University, New Jersey 08544.']","cappuccino and spire are unique Drosophila maternal-effect loci that participate in pattern formation in both the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes of the early embryo. Mutant females produce embryos lacking pole cells, polar granules, and normal abdominal segmentation. They share these defects with the posterior group of maternal-effect genes. Although embryos are defective in abdominal segmentation, in double mutant combinations with Bicaudal D, abdominal segments can be formed in the anterior half of the egg. This indicates that embryos produced by mutant females contain the 'posterior determinant' required for abdominal segmentation (Nüsslein-Volhard et al. 1987) and suggests that the wild-type gene products are not required for production of the posterior determinant but, rather, for its localization or stabilization. The vasa protein, a component of polar granules, is not localized at the posterior pole of mutant egg chambers or embryos, providing additional support for the hypothesis that localization to or stabilization of substances at the posterior pole of the egg chamber is defective in mutant females. Females mutant for the strongest alleles also produce dorsalized embryos. Phenotypic analysis reveals that these dorsalized embryos also have abdominal segmentation defects. The mutant phenotypes can be ordered in a series of increasing severity. Pole cell formation is most sensitive to loss of functional gene products, followed by abdominal segmentation, whereas normal dorsoventral patterning is the least sensitive to loss of functional gene products. In addition, mutant females contain egg chambers that appear to be dorsalized, resulting in the production of eggs with dorsalized eggshells. Germ-line mosaics indicate that cappuccino and spire are required in the oocyte-nurse cell complex. This suggests that the eggshell phenotype results from altered pattern in the underlying germ cell. Also, we defined the epistatic relationships between several early patterning loci, on the basis of an analysis of the eggs and embryos produced by females doubly mutant for cappuccino or spire and other loci that affect the pattern of both the egg and the embryo. On the basis of our current knowledge of the genes involved in this process, we formulated a working model for the early steps in dorsoventral patterning."

Biotinylated antisense oligonucleotides that hybridize specifically to the RNA of interest provide a general approach to develop affinity reagents for these experiments. Such oligonucleotides can be used to enrich endogenous RNAs from cross-linked chromatin extracts to study the genomic binding sites of RNAs. These hybridization capture protocols are evolving modular experiments that are compatible with a range of cross-linkers and conditions. This review discusses the principles of these hybridization capture experiments as well as considerations and controls necessary to interpret the resulting data without being misled by artifactual signals.

To define the domain in Saccharomyces cerevisiae SRP that is homologous to the mammalian Alu domain [Alu domain homolog in yeast (Adhy)], we examined the assembly of a yeast protein homologous to mammalian SRP14 (Srp14p) and scR1 RNA. Srp14p binds as a homodimeric complex to the 5' sequences of scR1 RNA. Its minimal binding site consists of 99 nt. (Adhy RNA), comprising a short hairpin structure followed by an extended stem. As in mammalian SRP9/14, the motif UGUAAU present in most SRP RNAs is part of the Srp14p binding sites as shown by footprint and mutagenesis studies. In addition, certain basic amino acid residues conserved between mammalian SRP14 and Srp14p are essential for RNA binding in both proteins. These findings confirm the common ancestry of the yeast and the mammalian components and indicate that Srp14p together with Adhy RNA represents the Alu domain homolog in yeast SRP that may comprise its elongation arrest function. Despite the similarities, Srp14p selectively recognizes only scR1 RNA, revealing substantial changes in RNA-protein recognition as well as in the overall structure of the complex. The alignment of the three yeast SRP RNAs known to date suggests a common structure for the putative elongation arrest domain of all three organisms."

Dioscorea is a major staple food in many parts of the world, especially in West Africa and the Pacific islands, and serves as a famine food in many regions. It is a critically important but neglected crop, which is likely to increase in importance as climate change leads to necessary changes in global food systems. It is a herbaceous, climbing, tropical monocot that looks rather like a dicot, and is part of a lineage that is relatively closely related to the phylogenetically derived group containing the grasses. Therefore, it represents an important biological link between the eudicots and grasses--groups that contain all the model flowering plant species--and has the potential to fill gaps in our knowledge of plant biology and evolution. Yams also offer us the possibility to gain new insights into processes such as tuberization and sex determination, which cannot be studied in current model organisms. This combination of rising importance due to its socioeconomic significance and interesting biology and evolutionary position justify its potential as a model organism. This potential remains to be harnessed, and much of the current work on yam is directed toward its role as a food crop. This aspect will remain important, but its potential for answering questions of basic biological interest will be a major motivation for researchers interested in this organism."

Chronic hepatitis may develop in immunosuppressed individuals, including transplant recipients, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, and persons with hematologic malignancy undergoing chemotherapy, and may progress to life-threatening liver cirrhosis. Extrahepatic manifestations of infection may include neurological and renal disease.

Other tri-snRNP-specific contacts were also detected, indicating the dynamic nature of protein interactions with this important snRNA. The uridine-rich extreme 3' end of U6 RNA was shown to be essential but not sufficient for the association of the Lsm proteins. Interestingly, the Lsm proteins associate efficiently with the 3' half of U6, which contains the 3' stem-loop and uridine-rich 3' end, suggesting that the Lsm and Sm proteins may recognize similar features in RNAs."

Using an in vitro translation assay, we demonstrate that SRE-dependent repression occurs in extracts from early stage embryos. Immunodepletion of Smaug from the extracts eliminates repression, consistent with the notion that Smaug is involved.

Three alleles of the C/EBP gene were identified according to restriction fragment length polymorphisms. The strain distribution pattern of the three alleles was determined in recombinant inbred mouse strains and compared to that of other mouse genes. These results mapped the gene to a position within 2.5 centimorgans (cM) of the structural gene encoding glucose phosphate isomerase on chromosome 7 of the mouse. The expression pattern of the C/EBP gene was studied by a combination of nucleic acid hybridization and antibody staining assays. High levels of C/EBP mRNA were observed in tissues known to metabolize lipid and cholesterol-related compounds at uncommonly high rates. These included liver, fat, intestine, lung, adrenal gland, and placenta. More detailed analysis of two of these tissues, liver and fat, showed that C/EBP expression was limited to fully differentiated cells. Moreover, analysis of the temporal pattern of expression of C/EBP mRNA in two tissues, liver and intestine, revealed a coordinated induction just prior to birth. These observations raise the possibility that the synthesis of C/EBP may be responsive to humoral factors and that modulation in C/EBP expression might mediate coordinated changes in gene expression that facilitate adaptive challenges met during development or during the fluctuating physiological states of adult life."

Electrophoretically purified p50, after renaturation, gave rise to a protein-DNA complex that migrated faster than that made by native NF-kappaB. Reconstitution of p50 and p65 together produced a protein that combined with DNA to form a complex with electrophoretic mobility indistinguishable from that of the complex formed by nuclear extracts and DOC-treated cytosolic fractions. Sedimentation and gel filtration analyses indicate that alone, the p50 protein exists as a dimer; two molecules of p65 bind to it to form a heterotetramer. Unlike I kappaB, the specific inhibitor of NF-kappaB, p65 displayed no inhibitor activity and was not released from NF-kappaB by DOC. p65 did not change the DNA binding specificity or the stimulatory effect of GTP on the p50 homodimer. Surprisingly, NF-kappaB could only be inactivated by I kappaB when p65 was bound. It would appear that one function of p65 is to make NF-kappaB susceptible to inhibition by I kappaB."

In the majority of the strains, the beta-galactosidase reporter gene in the P-transposon responds to nearby transcriptional regulatory sequences in the genome. A remarkable diversity of spatially and temporally regulated staining patterns is observed in embryos carrying different insertions. We selected numerous strains as markers for different embryonic organs, tissues, and cells. Many of these strains should allow the study of complex developmental processes, such as nervous system development, which have not been convenient to analyze previously. Also, we present genetic evidence that some of the detected regulatory elements control nearby Drosophila genes. In light of our results, we discuss the diversity and complexity of cis-acting regulatory elements in the genome and the general applications of the enhancer detector method for the study of Drosophila development."

The action of Rex is sequence specific, requiring the presence of a cis-acting Rex response element located in the 3' long terminal repeat. This element corresponds to a predicted RNA secondary structure and functions in an orientation-dependent but position-independent manner. Rex acts through this response element to stimulate the nuclear export of the unspliced or singly spliced viral mRNA species encoding the virion structural proteins that are normally excluded from the cytoplasm. Although the Rex proteins of HTLV-I and HTLV-II can also function via the related Rev response element present in the env gene of the type I human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), the analogous HIV-1 Rev protein is unable to act on the HTLV-I Rex response element. This nonreciprocal pattern of genetic complementation by Rex and Rev suggests that these viral trans-regulators may interact directly with their RNA response elements."

Several nuclear bodies are nucleated by specific architectural noncoding RNAs (arcRNAs) acting as structural scaffolds. We have reported that a minor population of cellular RNAs exhibits an unusual semi-extractable feature upon using the conventional procedure of RNA preparation and that needle shearing or heating of cell lysates remarkably improves extraction of dozens of RNAs. Because semi-extractable RNAs, including known arcRNAs, commonly localize in nuclear bodies, this feature may be a hallmark of arcRNAs. Using the semi-extractability of RNA, we performed genome-wide screening of semi-extractable long noncoding RNAs to identify new candidate arcRNAs for arcRNA under hyperosmotic and heat stress conditions. After screening stress-inducible and semi-extractable RNAs, hundreds of readthrough downstream-of-gene (DoG) transcripts over several hundreds of kilobases, many of which were not detected among RNAs prepared by the conventional extraction procedure, were found to be stress-inducible and semi-extractable. We further characterized some of the abundant DoGs and found that stress-inducible transient extension of the 3′-UTR made DoGs semi-extractable. Furthermore, they were localized in distinct nuclear foci that were sensitive to 1,6-hexanediol. These data suggest that semi-extractable DoGs exhibit arcRNA-like features and our semi-extractable RNA-seq is a powerful tool to extensively monitor DoGs that are induced under specific physiological conditions."
Selection for B cells with productive IgL gene rearrangements occurs in the bursa of Fabricius during chicken embryonic development.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.6.838,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/6/838,3,6,06/01/1989,838,847,"['W T McCormack', 'L W Tjoelker', 'C F Barth', 'L M Carlson', 'B Petryniak', 'E H Humphries', 'C B Thompson']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109.']","The vast majority of immunoglobulin-expressing mature chicken B lymphocytes contain one functionally rearranged and one unrearranged allele of the immunoglobulin light chain (IgL) gene. Therefore, nearly all IgL V-J rearrangements present in mature chickens are in-frame. In contrast, the Ig genes of mature mammalian B cells contain a high proportion of out-of-frame V-J joints. To investigate the basis for this difference, gene rearrangement at the chicken IgL locus was characterized during embryonic development and in mature B-cell lines. Joining of the single functional variable (VL) segment with the single joining (JL) segment occurs in cells in multiple tissues during a transient period of chicken embryogenesis. Only one-third of the V-J joints cloned from days 10-12 of development are in-frame. An increasing proportion of in-frame V-J joints is observed within the bursa of Fabricius at successively later stages of development. Our data suggest that the bursa of Fabricius serves during embryonic development as a site of selective amplification of cells that have undergone productive V-J joining, such that nearly all V-J joints present in postembryonic B cells are in-frame. The high frequency of rearranged alleles joined in-frame that is found in posthatching bursal cells and mature B-cell lines appears to result from a low frequency with which cells undergo IgL rearrangement at both alleles, rather than from an increase in the precision of V-J joining in avian species."

Using a site-directed ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking approach, we have mapped the regions of the ribozyme that are in close proximity to a substrate that contains the mRNA sequence encoding thymidine kinase of human herpes simplex virus 1. Our data suggest that the cleavage site of the mRNA substrate is positioned at the same regions of the ribozyme that bind to the cleavage site of a ptRNA.

We developed a novel outcome devaluation procedure to discriminate goal-directed from habitual responding in cocaine-seeking rats. This procedure elicits devaluation temporarily and requires no additional training, allowing repeated testing at different time points. After training male rats to self-administer IV cocaine, we devalued the drug outcome via experimenter-administered IV cocaine (a “satiety” procedure) prior to a 10-min extinction test. Many rats were sensitive to outcome devaluation, a hallmark of goal-directed responding. These animals reduced responding when given a dose of experimenter-administered cocaine that matched or exceeded satiety levels during self-administration. However, other rats were insensitive to experimenter-administered cocaine, suggesting their responding was habitual. Importantly, reinforcement schedules and neural manipulations that produce goal-directed responding (i.e., ratio schedules or dorsolateral striatum lesions) caused sensitivity to outcome devaluation, whereas reinforcement schedules and neural manipulations that produce habitual responding (i.e., interval schedules or dorsomedial striatum lesions) caused insensitivity. Satiety-based outcome devaluation is an innovative new tool to dissect the neural and behavioral mechanisms underlying IV cocaine-seeking behavior."

The influence of extrinsic cues on asymmetric cell division in plants is well documented. Recently, candidate intrinsic factors have been identified and links between intrinsic and extrinsic components are beginning to be elucidated. A novel mechanism in breaking symmetry was revealed that involves the movement of typically intrinsic factors between plant cells. As we learn more about the regulation of asymmetric cell divisions in plants, we can begin to reflect on the similarities and differences between the strategies used by plants and animals. Focusing on the underlying molecular mechanisms, this article describes three selected cases of symmetry-breaking events in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana .

The importance of using computer vision-based methods to accomplish this task is well recognized. However, in practice, investigators often encounter obstacles that render the application of computational image processing in cell biology far from routine. First, it is not always clear which measurements are necessary to characterize a molecular system and whether these measurements are sufficient to characterize the cellular process under investigation. Second, even when the requirements for measurements are well defined, it often is difficult to find a software tool to extract these data. It can be even more challenging to find software tools to answer specific questions raised by the hypotheses underlying the experiments. One solution is for investigators to develop their own software tools. This is feasible for some applications with the assistance of commercial and open-source software packages that support the assembly and integration of custom-designed algorithms, even for users with limited computational expertise. Another solution is for investigators to develop interdisciplinary collaborations with computer scientists. Such collaborations require close interaction between the computer scientists and experimental biologists to optimize the data acquisition and analytical procedures, which must be tightly coupled in any project applying computational analysis to biological image data.

Subjects understood the goal for task success, but they had to learn a motor strategy of what pattern of serial movements to make and the tactics of how much to scale their amplitudes and timing. We compared the time course for acquiring tactical skill with that for acquiring knowledge of strategy and of tactics, and their necessary cues. Implicit and declarative knowledge were distinguished from one another by correlating subjects' verbal self-reports with movement kinematics and their results. Implicit generation of the correct strategy and of the tactics developed in an exploratory manner from the beginning of the learning session. Implicit strategy learning soon gave way to conscious efforts, but tactical learning remained implicit until its first unambiguous verbal declaration (with one exception). First strategy declarations were voiced before those for tactics, during trial-and-error learning that did not require task success, and referred to reversing the direction of hand movements (one exception). In contrast, first declarations of tactics almost always required actual or imminent success, referred to when direction was to be reversed, and it was achieved near the top of a sigmoid learning curve that rose to tactical skill (with one exception). During the sigmoid rise, movement amplitudes and timing were optimized in a distinct manner, although tactics usually adapted thereafter to movements of more moderate speed that could still be successful."
CpG methylation of the cAMP-responsive enhancer/promoter sequence TGACGTCA abolishes specific factor binding as well as transcriptional activation.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.5.612,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/5/612,3,5,05/01/1989,612,619,"['S M Iguchi-Ariga', 'W Schaffner']","['Institut für Molekularbiologie II, Universität Zürich, Switzerland.']","In mammals and other vertebrates, cytosine methylation in CpG sites is often negatively correlated with gene activity. Because methylation of the promoter region is most crucial for this effect, the simplest hypothesis is that CpG methylation interferes with the binding of specific transcription factors. We have examined this hypothesis with two different transcription factor-binding sites that contain a CpG dinucleotide, namely the cAMP-responsive element (CRE; 5'-TGACGTCA) and the Sp1-binding site (5'-GTGAGGCGGTGAGACT). We have reported previously that CpG methylation of the Sp1-binding site affected neither factor binding nor transcription in HeLa cells, which may be related to the fact that Sp1 is typically associated with promoters of housekeeping genes. In contrast, CREs are often associated with promoters of cell type-specific genes. A synthetic oligonucleotide containing two tandem CREs derived from the gene encoding the human glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit was cloned upstream of a reporter gene. Transcription of this gene was dependent on the CRE sequences in both PC12 and HeLa cells. Bandshift and methylation interference assays show that similar, if not the same, factor(s) bind to the CRE in both cell lines, even though induction by cAMP was only observed in PC12 cells. CpG methylation of the CRE consensus sequences (TGACGTCA) resulted in loss of specific factor binding, as well as loss of transcriptional activity in vitro and in vivo, in both cell types. This suggests that the inactivity of methylated promoters can, at least in some cases, be explained by their inability to bind specific transcription factors."

Although both NOTCH1 and ROS1 are established proto-oncogenes, our study is the first to describe the mechanistic role of NOTCH1 – ROS1 fusion arising via intrachromosomal rearrangement. NOTCH1–ROS1 displayed potent neoplastic transformation propensity in vitro, and harbors tumorigenic potential in vivo, where it induced oncogenic activation of the MAPK, PI3K/mTOR, and JAK–STAT signaling pathways in a murine allograft model. We found an unexpected contribution of the NOTCH1 extracellular region in mediating NOTCH1–ROS1 activation and oncogenic function, highlighting the contribution of both NOTCH1 and ROS1 fusion partners in driving tumorigenicity. Interestingly, neither membrane localization nor fusion protein dimerization were found to be essential for NOTCH1–ROS1 fusion oncogenicity. To target NOTCH1–ROS1-driven tumors, we tested both NOTCH1-directed inhibitors and ROS1-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in heterologous models (NIH3T3, Ba/F3). Although NOTCH1 inhibitors did not suppress NOTCH1–ROS1-driven oncogenic growth, we found that oral entrectinib treatment effectively suppressed the growth of NOTCH-ROS1-driven tumors. Taken together, we report the first known pAS case with a novel NOTCH1–ROS1 alteration along with a detailed report on the function and therapeutic targeting of NOTCH1–ROS1.

These experiments inspired Wolpert's French flag model, which is a classic among morphogen gradient models. Subsequent molecular and genetic analysis in the mouse identified retinoic acid as proximal signal, and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) as the essential instructive signals produced by AER and ZPA, respectively. Recent studies provide good evidence that progenitors are specified early with respect to their PD and AP fates and that morpho-regulatory signaling is also required for subsequent proliferative expansion of the specified progenitor pools. The determination of particular fates seems to occur rather late and depends on additional signals such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which indicates that cells integrate signaling inputs over time and space. The coordinate regulation of PD and AP axis patterning is controlled by an epithelial–mesenchymal feedback signaling system, in which transcriptional regulation of the BMP antagonist Gremlin1 integrates inputs from the BMP, SHH, and FGF pathways. Vertebrate limb-bud development is controlled by a 4-dimensional (4D) patterning system integrating positive and negative regulatory feedback loops, rather than thresholds set by morphogen gradients."
Sequences that surround the stop codons of upstream open reading frames in GCN4 mRNA determine their distinct functions in translational control.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.8.1217,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/8/1217,3,8,08/01/1989,1217,1225,"['P F Miller', 'A G Hinnebusch']","['Unit on Molecular Genetics of Lower Eukaryotes, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",Translational control of the GCN4 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires at least two of the four short upstream open reading frames (URFs) in the leader of GCN4 mRNA. URF4 is a strong negative element that is sufficient for repression of GCN4 expression in normal growth conditions. URF1 is approximately 30-fold less effective as a translational barrier when it is the single URF present in the mRNA leader and is required upstream from URF4 for efficient derepression of GCN4 expression under amino acid starvation conditions. We show that the last codon plus 10 bp immediately after the stop codon of URF4 are sufficient to convert URF1 into a strong translational barrier when it is present as a solitary URF. This result suggests that the characteristics of translation termination at URF4 are responsible largely for its strong inhibitory effect on translation initiation at the GCN4 AUG codon. Introduction of the same URF4 sequences at URF1 also reduces GCN4 expression under derepressing conditions when URF1 is upstream from URF4. This fact suggests that URF1 translation normally is compatible with efficient scanning and initiation downstream and that this property is required for its ability to overcome the translational barrier at URF4. These findings are consistent with the idea that ribosomes must first translate URF1 and then resume scanning in order to traverse URF4 sequences under starvation conditions. Our results indicate that nucleotides located 3' to the stop codon can be as important as those located 5' to the start site in determining the inhibitory effect of an URF on translation initiation downstream.
Two TFIIIA activities regulate expression of the Xenopus 5S RNA gene families.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.10.1602,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/10/1602,3,10,10/01/1989,1602,1612,"['J Blanco', 'L Millstein', 'M A Razik', 'S Dilworth', 'C Cote', 'J Gottesfeld']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, California 92037.']","Immunoblotting experiments with polyclonal and monoclonal anti-transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) antibodies reveal different electrophoretic forms of TFIIIA in extracts from immature and mature oocytes of Xenopus laevis. The well-characterized 39-kD TFIIIA species is present in approximately 10(12) copies per cell in stage I-III previtellogenic oocytes and declines in abundance by 10- to 20-fold during oogenesis. An immunologically related protein of apparent molecular mass of 42 kD is present at 2-4% of the level of 39-kD TFIIIA in immature oocytes, and the level of this protein increases dramatically during oogenesis. Both the 39- and 42-kD proteins are complexed with 5S RNA in 7S ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles. High-level transcription of the oocyte-type 5S genes in vitro requires 39-kD immature oocyte TFIIIA, whereas both 39-kD TFIIIA and the mature oocyte TFIIIA species of 42 kD support somatic-type 5S transcription. TFIIIA of 42 kD does not support oocyte-type 5S transcription in a fractionated transcription system derived from mature oocytes. Both proteins, however, bind the oocyte-type and somatic-type genes with comparable affinities and exhibit similar DNase footprints on both genes. These results suggest a model for the developmental regulation of 5S RNA gene transcription where 42-kD TFIIIA serves as an activator of somatic-type 5S transcription and as a repressor of oocyte-type transcription during early embryogenesis."

Upcoming problems will include (1) greatly increased search times, (2) an increase in background noise of high-scoring but biologically irrelevant matches, (3) inaccurate coding region prediction, leading to problems in protein data base searching, and (4) limited first-pass sequence annotation, making it difficult to determine the biological relevance of data base hits.

The Drosophila mutation turnip has pleiotropic behavioral effects and does not specifically affect learning.,Learning & Memory,Learn.

PKC has been found in the nervous systems of a wide range of organisms and appears to have an important role in learning and memory-related processes. Unfortunately, previous reports documenting the learning defect of tur lacked the controls required to assess the origins of the poor performance of the mutant. We have analyzed the effects of the tur mutation on both associative and nonassociative learning as well as on PKC activity. Additionally, the effects of the mutation on the task-relevant sensorimotor abilities of the flies were assessed. Although we were able to replicate previous behavioral and biochemical results obtained with tur, we discovered that the tur mutation also affected response to electric shock and caused a drastic reduction in the locomotor ability of the flies. Because locomotion is an essential component of the learning assays, this result makes it impossible to conclude that tur specifically affects learning and demonstrates the crucial importance of sensorimotor controls in conditioning experiments."

Here we report a patient with a severe, multisystem metabolic disorder who inherited two copies of Chromosome 12 from her father. He was a heterozygous carrier of a variant in the muscle-specific enzyme 6-phosphofructokinase ( PFKM ) gene and of a truncating variant in the pseudouridine synthase 1 ( PUS1 ) gene (both on Chromosome 12), resulting in a homozygous state of these mutations in his daughter. The PFKM gene functions in glycolysis and is linked to Tarui syndrome. The PUS1 gene functions in mitochondrial tRNA processing and is linked to myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA). Analysis of human dermal fibroblasts, which do not express PFKM , revealed a loss of PUS1 mRNA and PUS1 protein only in the patient cells compared to healthy controls. The patient cells also revealed a reduction of the mitochondrial-encoded protein MTCO1, whereas levels of the nuclear-encoded SDHA remained unchanged, suggesting a specific impairment of mitochondrial translation. Further destabilization of these cells is suggested by the altered levels of BAX, BCL-2, and TP53 proteins, alterations that become augmented upon exposure of the cells to DNA damage. The results illustrate the efficacy of UPiD events to reveal rare pathogenic variants in human disease and demonstrate how these events can lead to cellular destabilization."

P. haloplanktis is also shown to have a complex genome structure, composed of two large replicons of approximately 2700 and 800 kb. Three pieces of evidence support this conclusion: (1) Two separate bands are always seen in PFGE of undigested P. haloplanktis DNA; (2) restriction digests of the larger band are missing a band of approximately 650 kb compared with restriction digests of total genomic DNA; and (3) a 16S rDNA probe hybridized to the larger replicon but not to the smaller.

Since then, many studies have validated the contributions of platelets to tumor angiogenesis, while uncovering novel roles for platelets in other angiogenic processes like wound resolution and retinal vascular disease. Although the majority of (lymph)angiogenesis occurs during development, platelets appear necessary for lymphatic but not vascular growth, implying their particular importance in pathological cases of adult angiogenesis.

Full-length PHIP, also called DCAF14, was recently identified to function as a replication stress response protein. Herein, we report the identification of two PHIP missense variants identified by exome sequencing in unrelated individuals with CJS. The variants p.D488V and p.E963G occur in different functional elements of DCAF14-WD40 repeat domain and pleckstrin homology-binding region (PBR), respectively. Using DNA fiber assays, we reveal that cells expressing either variant exhibit defective replication fork progression in conditions of replication stress. Furthermore, unlike wild-type DCAF14, both variants fail to accomplish DNA replication after exposure to genotoxic stress indicating a critical role of DCAF14 in protecting stalled replication forks. Thus, we have identified replication defects associated with CJS variants and predict replication-associated genome instability with CJS syndrome."

Here, we report the rat cDNA sequence of a zinc-finger transcription factor, Egr3/Pilot, and characterize its regulated mRNA expression in brain. Egr3 mRNA is rapidly and transiently induced in neurons of the hippocampus and cortex by electroconvulsive seizure. mRNA levels peak 2 hr after the seizure and remain elevated for as long as 8 hr. Egr3 mRNA is also rapidly induced in granule cells of the dentate gyrus by synaptic NMDA receptor activation elicited by patterned stimulation of the perforant pathway and by drugs that alter dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum. Basal levels of Egr3 mRNA in the cortex appear to be driven by natural synaptic activity because monocular deprivation rapidly decreases Egr3 mRNA in the deafferented visual cortex. Aspects of the protein structure, sequence-specific DNA binding, transcriptional activity, and regulation of Egr3 are highly similar to another zinc-finger transcription factor, Egr1/zif268. Moreover, we demonstrate colocalization of Egr3 and zif268 mRNAs in neurons of normal and stimulated cortex.

In this article, we present the design of a high-resolution optical tweezers, which is designed to minimize sensitivity to environmental noise. When the tether is attached to a stage, resolution is typically limited by drift and fluctuations in the relative position of the stage and trap-forming objective, cued by environmental noise. In a dual-trap design, however, the biological system is decoupled entirely from the stage by utilizing two optical traps to hold both ends of the tether. By holding each end of the molecule in an identical fashion, such dual-trap optical tweezers are less sensitive to drift and fluctuations of mechanical components. In our instrument, we form two traps from two orthogonally polarized beams generated by a single laser. As a result, many optical components and much of the optical path traveled are common to both trapping beams, thus minimizing differential movements of one optical trap relative to the other. Additionally, this economical use of optics creates an instrument that is simple and compact, reducing the number of elements susceptible to environmental fluctuations."

Iod scores at these two loci were 2.77 and 3.37, respectively. The SUR gene region accounted for 44.7% of the phenotypic variance. Evidence for linkage to fasting glucose concentration was also observed for two loci on chromosome 6, one of which is identical to a proposed susceptibility locus for type I diabetes (D6S290). When diabetics were excluded from the analyses, all Iod scores became zero, suggesting that the observed linkages were with the trait diabetes rather than with normal variation in glucose levels. Results were similar whether all diabetics were included in the analyses or only those who were not under treatment with oral antidiabetic agents or insulin."

This requirement is consistent with the Hebbian, or correlational, type of learning rule used in many neural network models. Recent evidence suggests that synaptic plasticity may depend in part on the production of a membrane permeant-diffusible signal so that spatial volume may also be involved in correlational learning rules. This latter form of synaptic change has been called volume learning. In both Hebbian and volume learning rules, interaction among synaptic inputs depends on the degree of coincidence of the inputs and is otherwise insensitive to their exact temporal order. Conditioning experiments and psychophysical studies have shown, however, that most animals are highly sensitive to the temporal order of the sensory inputs. Although these experiments assay the behavior of the entire animal or perceptual system, they raise the possibility that nervous systems may be sensitive to temporally ordered events at many spatial and temporal scales. We suggest here the existence of a new class of learning rule, called a predictive Hebbian learning rule, that is sensitive to the temporal ordering of synaptic inputs. We show how this predictive learning rule could act at single synaptic connections and through diffuse neuromodulatory systems."

The BRAF variant was an in-frame deletion mutation (ΔN486_P490), which had been previously demonstrated to be a kinase-activating alteration in the BRAF kinase domain. Working with the Novartis patient assistance program allowed us to treat the patient with the BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib. The patient's overall clinical condition improved dramatically with dabrafenib. Levels of serum tumor marker dropped immediately after treatment, and a subsequent CT scan revealed a significant decrease in the size of both primary and metastatic lesions. The dabrafenib-induced remission lasted for 6 mo. Preclinical studies published concurrently with the patient's treatment showed that the BRAF in-frame mutation (ΔNVTAP) induces oncogenic activation by a mechanism distinct from that induced by V600E, and that this difference dictates the responsiveness to different BRAF inhibitors. This study describes a dramatic instance of how high-level genomic technology and analysis was necessary and sufficient to identify a clinically logical treatment option that was then utilized and shown to be of clinical value for this individual."

To improve survival there is a need for increased molecular understanding of the disease, including chemotherapy sensitivity and resistance. We here present an unusual case concerning a young woman with extensive peritoneal mesothelioma who had a remarkable response to palliative chemotherapy (platinum/pemetrexed). Tumor samples collected at surgery before and after treatment were analyzed on the genomic and transcriptional levels (exome sequencing, RNA-seq, and smallRNA-seq). Integrative analysis of single nucleotide and copy-number variants, mutational signatures, and gene expression was performed to provide a comprehensive picture of the disease. LATS1/2 were identified as the main mutational drivers together with homozygous loss of BAP1 and PBRM1 , which also may have contributed to the extraordinary chemotherapy response. The presence of the S3 mutational signature is consistent with homologous recombination DNA repair defects due to BAP1 loss. Up-regulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway after treatment, supported by deactivated PTEN through miRNA regulation, is associated with cancer progression and could explain chemotherapy resistance. The molecular profile suggests potential benefit from experimental targeting of PARP, EZH2, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and possibly also from immune checkpoint inhibition. In addition to providing the molecular background for this unusual case of peritoneal mesothelioma, the results show the potential value of integrative genomic analysis in precision medicine."

Autosomal recessive OI type VIII is associated with biallelic pathogenic variants in P3H1 and classically characterized by skeletal anomalies in addition to significant bone fragility, sometimes presenting with in utero fractures and/or neonatal lethality. P3H1 encodes a collagen prolyl hydroxylase that critically 3-hydroxylates proline residue 986 on the α chain of collagen types I and II to achieve proper folding and assembly of mature collagen and is present in a complex with CRTAP and CypB. Most individuals with OI type VIII have had biallelic predicted loss-of-function variants leading to reduced or absent levels of P3H1 mRNA. The reported missense variants have all fallen in the catalytic domain of the protein and are thought to be associated with a milder phenotype. Here, we describe an infant presenting with five long bone fractures in the first year of life found to have a novel missense variant in trans with a nonsense variant in P3H1 without any other bony anomalies on imaging. We hypothesize that missense variants in the catalytic domain of P3H1 lead to decreased but not absent hydroxylation of Pro986, with preserved KDEL retention signal and complex stability, causing an attenuated phenotype."

We induced long-term desensitization of AMPA receptors in rat cerebellar slices by (1) a 4-min bath application of quisqualate (0.1 mM) or (2) a 15-min bath application of a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol-12,13-diacetate (0.5 microM) or -dibutyrate (0.6 microM), followed by a 4-min AMPA (0.1 mM) application. In slices so treated, labeling with an antibody (12P3) against a peptide corresponding to part of AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 including serine 696 and phosphorylated at this serine site revealed phosphorylation of the AMPA receptors in PC dendrites that was sustained for at least 1 hr. At an early phase, within 20 min after the chemical stimulation, the phosphorylation was resistant to an Ca2+ chelator (BAPTA-AM), a metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist (MCPG), and a PKC inhibitor (calphostin C), whereas at a late phase, 30 min or more after the chemical stimulation, it was blocked by these reagents similarly to long-term desensitization of AMPA receptors. Taken together with data obtained previously using different protocols of chemical stimulation, the present results strongly support the above-mentioned hypothesis."

This system is attractive for the study of neuronal information storage, both because of its duration and because it demonstrates input specificity. The mechanisms underlying input specificity in this system are not known, but they could involve presynaptic alterations, postsynaptic alterations, or some combination of both. To allow for an unambiguous analysis of postsynaptic processes, an LTD induction protocol has been developed using cultured cerebellar cells in which pulses of quisqualate and direct Purkinje neuron depolarization replace PF and CF stimulation, respectively. Input specificity is retained in this reduced system. When multiple, nonoverlapping quisqualate application sites are used, LTD is confined to those sites that are stimulated during depolarization. This property of LTD induction is also preserved under conditions where both spontaneous and evoked neurotransmitter releases are reduced or eliminated, indicating that postsynaptic alterations are sufficient to confer input specificity. Input-specific LTD may also be induced by local application of a protein kinase C (PKC) activator (1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol) together with direct Purkinje neuron depolarization, suggesting that input-specific LTD results from the conjunction of a spatially broad Ca signal mediated by Purkinje neuron depolarization, together with a spatially constrained PKC-activating signal mediated by quisqualate application."

The major form contains the U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs; the minor form contains the U11, U12, U4atac, U5, and U6atac snRNAs. Assembly and function of the major form are based on a complex dynamic of UsnRNA-UsnRNA and UsnRNA-pre-mRNA interactions, and the involved UsnRNA segments are highly posttranscriptionally modified in plants and vertebrates. To further characterize the minor form of spliceosomes, we looked for the psi residues in HeLa cells' U11, U12, U4atac, and U6atac snRNAs, using chemical approaches. Four psi residues were detected in total for these four atac UsnRNAs, compared to 20 in their counterparts of the major spliceosomes. The two psi residues detected in U12 are also found in U2 snRNA. One of them belongs to the branch-site-recognition sequence. It forms one of the base pairs that bulge out the A residue, responsible for the nucleophilic attack. Conservation of this strategic psi residue probably reflects a functional role. Another psi residue was detected in a U4atac snRNA segment involved in formation of helix II with U6atac. The fourth one was detected in the additional stem-loop structure present at the 3' end of U6atac snRNA. Differences in psi content of the atac and major UsnRNAs of human cells may participate in the differentiation of the two splicing systems. Based on secondary structure similarity, U2 and U12 snRNAs on the one hand and U4 and U4atac snRNAs on the other hand may share common psi synthases."

As part of efforts to isolate the genes involved in these disorders, we have begun to develop a comparative transcription map spanning this region in both species. Using techniques of cross-species conservation and hybridization, exon trapping, and cDNA selection we have identified four known genes or members of gene families--caltractin, a member of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor gene family, a member of the melanoma antigen gene (MAGE) family, and several members of the murine-specific, X-linked lymphocyte regulated gene (Xlr3) family. Trapped exons and, in some cases, longer cDNAs have been isolated for potentially 7-9 additional genes. One cDNA demonstrates highly significant homology with members of the Krüppel family of zinc finger transcription factors. A second novel cDNA demonstrates homology at the 3' end of the predicted amino acid sequence to a LIM domain consensus. Gene order appears conserved among those cDNAs determined to be present in both human and mouse. Three of the murine transcripts appear to be present in multiple copies within the Bpa/Str critical region and could be associated with a predisposition to genomic rearrangements. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and Northern analysis demonstrate that several of the transcripts are expressed in mid-gestation murine embryos and neonatal skin, making them candidates for the Bpa and Str mutations and their respective homologous human disorders."
Symmetry Breaking During Drosophila Oogenesis,Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol,,1943-0264,10.1101/cshperspect.a001891,http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/1/2/a001891,1,2,08/01/2009,a001891,,"['Siegfried Roth', 'Jeremy A. Lynch']","['Institute of Developmental Biology, University of Cologne, Gyrhofstr. 17, D-50923 Cologne, Germany']","The orthogonal axes of Drosophila are established during oogenesis through a hierarchical series of symmetry-breaking steps, most of which can be traced back to asymmetries inherent in the architecture of the ovary. Oogenesis begins with the formation of a germline cyst of 16 cells connected by ring canals. Two of these 16 cells have four ring canals, whereas the others have fewer. The first symmetry-breaking step is the selection of one of these two cells to become the oocyte. Subsequently, the germline cyst becomes surrounded by somatic follicle cells to generate individual egg chambers. The second symmetry-breaking step is the posterior positioning of the oocyte within the egg chamber, a process mediated by adhesive interactions with a special group of somatic cells. Posterior oocyte positioning is accompanied by a par gene-dependent repolarization of the microtubule network, which establishes the posterior cortex of the oocyte. The next two steps of symmetry breaking occur during midoogenesis after the volume of the oocyte has increased about 10-fold. First, a signal from the oocyte specifies posterior follicle cells, polarizing a symmetric prepattern present within the follicular epithelium. Second, the posterior follicle cells send a signal back to the oocyte, which leads to a second repolarization of the oocyte microtubule network and the asymmetric migration of the oocyte nucleus. This process again requires the par genes. The repolarization of the microtubule network results in the transport of bicoid and oskar mRNAs, the anterior and posterior determinants, respectively, of the embryonic axis, to opposite poles of the oocyte. The asymmetric positioning of the oocyte nucleus defines a cortical region of the oocyte where gurken mRNA is localized, thus breaking the dorsal–ventral symmetry of the egg and embryo."

Effect of the cap structure on pre-mRNA splicing in Xenopus oocyte nuclei.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.9.1472,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/9/1472,3,9,09/01/1989,1472,1479,"['K Inoue', 'M Ohno', 'H Sakamoto', 'Y Shimura']","['Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Science, Kyoto University, Japan.']","The effect of the 5' cap structure on the splicing of precursor mRNAs was investigated after the RNAs were injected into Xenopus oocyte nuclei. The precursor mRNAs synthesized in vitro in a prokaryotic transcription system with a dinucleotide, ApppG, as a primer, were extremely stable when injected into the nuclei yet behaved like uncapped pre-mRNAs in the in vitro splicing reaction. The ApppG-primed precursor mRNAs served as a control (uncapped) in the injection experiments, and their splicing reactions were compared with those of their capped (m7GpppG-primed) counterparts. The capped precursors were spliced more efficiently than the uncapped precursors. Examination of splicing of the precursor mRNA that contained three exons and two introns with a single molecule has revealed that the cap structure exerts its effect primarily on the 5'-proximal intron. Thus, the cap structure not only stabilizes precursor mRNAs but also plays a positive role in the splicing of precursor mRNAs in cells."

In this protocol, we discuss the use of Braid, free software for performing real-time, multicamera, multianimal tracking. We describe a setup with four cameras capable of tracking the three-dimensional (3D) position of mosquitoes at 100 frames per second in a volume of 30 cm × 30 cm × 60 cm with millimeter accuracy. The specific hardware configuration is flexible and can be substituted using different or additional components to adjust the tracking parameters as needed."

The pursuit of targeted therapeutic approaches, based not only on expression profiles but also on somatic mutations, is fundamental to the effort of improving survival in patients with glioblastoma. Here, we describe a missense DNMT3A p.P904S mutation in an IDH1 -mutant glioblastoma. Although never previously reported in gliomas, this mutation is predicted to be pathogenic and has been reported in several other malignancies. Our report suggests that elucidating epigenetic control is important to understanding glioblastoma biology and may likely unveil targets potentially important to glioblastoma treatment in an effort to improve survival."

Recent strategies have directly profiled miRNA–target interactions by crosslinking and ligation of sncRNAs to their targets within the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), followed by high-throughput sequencing of the chimeric sncRNA:target RNAs. Despite the strength of these direct profiling approaches, standardized pipelines for effectively analyzing the resulting chimeric sncRNA:target RNA sequencing data are not readily available.

Protein sequence conservation varied between 36% and 100% identity, with an average value of 85%. The average degree of nucleotide sequence identity for the corresponding coding sequences was also approximately 85%, whereas 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) were less conserved, with aligned identities of 67% and 69%, respectively. For some mouse and human genes, nucleotide sequences are more highly conserved than the encoded protein sequences. A subset of 32 sequences, consisting of only mouse/human protein pairs for which the human sequence represents a positionally cloned disease gene, had properties very similar to the larger data set, suggesting that our data are representative of the genome as a whole. With respect to sequence conservation, two interesting outliers are the breast cancer (BRCAI) gene product and the testis-determining factor (SRY), both of which display among the lowest degrees of sequence identity. The occurrence of both introns and repetitive elements (e.g., Alu, Bl) in 5' and 3' UTRs was also studied. These results provide one benchmark for the ""comparative genomics"" of mice and humans, with practical implications for the cross-referencing of transcript maps. Also, they should prove useful in estimating the additional sampling diversity provided by mouse EST sequencing projects designed to complement the existing human cDNA collection."

On the basis of the neurophysiological evidence, we summarize two neuronal mechanisms that subserve the acquisition of form selectivity in AIT neurons. The first mechanism is neuronal tuning to particular stimuli that were learned in a cognitive task. The second mechanism is association, with which relevant information can be retrieved from other stored memories. On the grounds that long-term memory of objects is acquired and organized by at least these two neuronal mechanisms in the temporal association area, we further present a model of the cognitive memory system that unifies perception and imagery."

The biochemical cascades involved in rapid S1P signaling are well understood. However, gene-expression regulation by S1PRs are less understood. In this review, we focus our attention to how S1PRs regulate nuclear chromatin changes and gene transcription to modulate vascular and lymphatic endothelial phenotypic changes during embryonic development and adult homeostasis. Because S1PR-targeted drugs approved for use in the treatment of autoimmune diseases cause substantial vascular-related adverse events, these findings are critical not only for general understanding of stimulus-evoked gene regulation in the vascular endothelium, but also for therapeutic development of drugs for autoimmune and perhaps vascular diseases."

We purified the factor responsible for recognizing the third rpoH promoter (rpoH P3) and identified it as RNA polymerase containing a novel sigma-factor with an apparent Mr of 24,000. This new sigma, which we call sigma E, is distinct from the known sigma factors in molecular weight and promoter specificity. sigma E holoenzyme will not recognize the sigma 70- or sigma 32-controlled promoters we tested, but it does transcribe the htrA gene, which is required for viability at temperatures greater than 42 degrees C. The in vivo role of sigma E is not known.

By use of a gene fusion of the alpha A-crystallin promoter to the viral immortalizing oncogene, polyoma large T antigen (PyLT), we created transgenic mice that express PyLT specifically in ocular lens. Expression of large T antigen during embryonic development led to a perturbation in lens development, specifically, an interference with the normal program of fiber cell differentiation. This resulted in microphthalmia, which persisted throughout the life of the animal. Histological analysis revealed impairment of cell elongation, denucleation, and mitotic senescence in both primary and secondary fiber cell differentiation. Strikingly, there was no evidence for hyperplasia or for tumor development in vivo, unlike the consequences of many immortalizing oncogenes on tissues in other transgenic mice. In vitro, however, the developmentally perturbed cells derived from the transgenic lens showed high proliferative capacity. Our results suggest that a primary effect of aberrant expression of an immortalizing gene is an interference with normal tissue development; however, this interference may not necessarily induce proliferation or lead to tumor formation."

Because of vaccines, hepatitis A has become increasingly a disease of adults instead of early childhood in many regions of the world, resulting in an age-related shift toward more severe disease.

As an approach to defining the mechanism responsible for activating the expression of these genes, we investigated the binding of nuclear factors to the promoters of two differentiation-induced genes, the 422(aP2) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) genes. DNase I footprinting and gel retardation analysis identified two binding regions within the promoters of each gene that interact with nuclear factors present in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. One differentiation-induced nuclear factor interacts specifically with a single binding site in the promoter of each gene. Competition experiments showed that the interaction of this nuclear factor with the SCD1 promoter was prevented specifically by a synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to the site footprinted in the 422(aP2) promoter. Several lines of evidence indicate that the differentiation-induced nuclear factor is CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), a DNA-binding protein first isolated from rat liver. Bacterially expressed recombinant C/EBP binds to the same site at which the differentiation-specific nuclear factor interacts within the promoter of each gene. Northern analysis with RNA from 3T3-L1 cells shows that C/EBP mRNA abundance increases markedly during differentiation. Transient cotransfection studies using a C/EBP expression vector demonstrate that C/EBP can function as a trans-activator of both the 422(aP2) and SCD1 gene promoters."

Precise identification of cellular targets for these drugs requires comprehensive profiling of the cancer genome coupled with an efficient analytic pipeline, leading to an informed decision on drug selection, prognosis, and confirmation of the original pathological diagnosis. Acquisition of optimal tumor tissue for such analysis is paramount and often presents logistical challenges in neurosurgery. Here, we describe the experience and results of the Personalized OncoGenomics (POG) program with a focus on tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). Patients with recurrent CNS tumors were consented and enrolled into the POG program prior to accrual of tumor and matched blood followed by whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing and processing through the POG bioinformatic pipeline. Sixteen patients were enrolled into POG. In each case, POG analyses identified genomic drivers including novel oncogenic fusions, aberrant pathways, and putative therapeutic targets. POG has highlighted that personalized oncology is truly a multidisciplinary field, one in which neurosurgeons must play a vital role if these programs are to succeed and benefit our patients."

On activation, p53 prevents the emergence of cancer cells by initiating cell cycle arrest, senescence (terminal cell cycle arrest), or apoptosis. Although its role in assuring longevity by suppressing cancer is well established, recent studies obtained largely from genetically engineered mouse models suggest that p53 may regulate longevity and aging. In some contexts, it appears that altered p53 activity may enhance longevity, and in others, it appears to suppress longevity and accelerate aging phenotypes. Here, we discuss how genetically engineered mouse models have been used to explore antiproliferative functions of p53 in cancer suppression and how mouse models with altered aging phenotypes have shed light on how p53 might influence the aging process."

Transcription from a cloned PLF promoter is inducible by phorbol esters, and this induction involves a region of 31 bp that includes an AP-1 site and a cluster of sites similar to the simian virus 40 (SV40) SphI element. The mutation of either the AP-1 or the SphI sites abolishes phorbol ester induction, and the transfer of this 31-bp sequence to a site upstream of a minimal promoter is sufficient to confer phorbol-ester responsiveness. In contrast to phorbol esters, glucocorticoids repress PLF transcription, which results in a reduced accumulation of PLF mRNA in serum-stimulated cells. Repression is dependent on the glucocorticoid receptor, which binds to the PLF promoter in a region that includes the AP-1 site, and the 31-bp phorbol ester 12-O-tetra decanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-inducible region is sufficient to mediate glucocorticoid repression. In addition, extracts from glucocorticoid-treated and untreated mouse cells are found to differ in the nature of the protein complexes that interact with the AP-1 site."

NMD3 was shown to encode an essential, highly conserved protein that associated principally with free 60S ribosomal subunits. Overexpression of a truncated form of Nmd3p, lacking 100 C-terminal amino acids and most of its Upf1p-interacting domain, had dominant-negative effects on both cell growth and protein synthesis and promoted the formation of polyribosome half-mers. These effects were eliminated by truncation of an additional 100 amino acids from Nmd3p. Overexpression of the nmd3delta100 allele also led to increased synthesis and destabilization of some ribosomal protein mRNAs, and increased synthesis and altered processing of 35S pre-rRNA. Our data suggest that Nmd3p has a role in the formation, function, or maintenance of the 60S ribosomal subunit and may provide a link for Upf1p to 80S monosomes."

Until a few years ago, the only method available for such studies was low-throughput analysis in which a single gene was selected and either genotyped for known genetic variants or sequenced to identify such variants. With the completion of the Human Genome Mapping Project, we have learned that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are frequent in the genome and that variants in physical proximity tend to correlate in genotype. Therefore, a major international effort was started to map this correlation in the form of the International HapMap Project. The concurrent advances in genetic laboratory techniques, statistical methods, and computing power, coupled with the information from the HapMap, have allowed large-scale microchip-based technologies to be used to assay large numbers of SNPs quickly and easily. Thus, truly genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can now be performed, analogous to linkage studies of Mendelian diseases in having no prior hypothesis of the chromosomal location responsible for disease. In this article, we will only discuss case-control studies in which family members are not analyzed, but the principles apply to large-scale family-based association studies as well."

This need for quantitative precision is challenged by fluctuations in the environmental conditions and by variations in the genetic makeup of the developing embryos. We discuss mechanisms that buffer morphogen profiles against variations in gene dosage. Self-enhanced morphogen degradation and pre-steady-state decoding provide general means for buffering the morphogen profile against fluctuations in morphogen production rate. A more specific “shuttling” mechanism, which establishes a sharp and robust activation profile of a widely expressed morphogen, and enables the adjustment of morphogen profile with embryo size, is also described. Finally, we consider the transformation of the smooth gradient profile into sharp borders of gene expression in the signal-receiving cells. The integration theory and experiments are increasingly used, providing key insights into the system-level functioning of the developmental system."

These phenomena are addressed in terms of critical pathways and network properties, as well as the sites and rules for synaptic plasticity. The theory is based on four primary hypotheses: (1) Two cerebellar sites of plasticity are involved in conditioning: (a) bidirectional long-term depression/potentiation at granule cell synapses onto Purkinje cells (gr-->Pkj) in the cerebellar cortex and (b) bidirectional plasticity in the interpositus nucleus that is controlled by inhibitory inputs from Purkinje cells; (2) climbing fiber activity is regulated to an equilibrium level at which the net strength of gr-->Pkj synapses remains constant unless an unexpected unconditioned stimulus (US) is presented or an expected US is omitted; (3) a time-varying representation of the conditioned stimulus (CS) in the cerebellar cortex permits the temporal discrimination required for conditioned response timing; and (4) the ability of a particular segment of the CS to be represented consistently across trials varies as a function of time since CS onset. This variation in across-trials consistency is thought to contribute to the ISI function. The model suggests several empirically testable predictions, some of which have been tested recently."

Key stimulus-coding events occur in peripheral olfactory sensory neurons, which typically express a single olfactory receptor—from a large repertoire encoded in the genome—with a defined ligand-response profile. These receptors convert odor ligand recognition into spatial and temporal patterns of neural activity that are transmitted to, and interpreted in, central brain regions. Drosophila provides an attractive model to study olfactory coding because it possesses a relatively simple peripheral olfactory system that displays many organizational parallels to those of vertebrates. Moreover, nearly all olfactory sensory neurons have been molecularly characterized and are accessible for physiological analysis, as they are exposed on the surface of sensory organs (antennae and maxillary palps) housed in specialized hairs called sensilla. This protocol describes how to perform recordings of odor-evoked activity from Drosophila olfactory sensilla, covering the basics of sample preparation, setting up the electrophysiology rig, assembling an odor stimulus-delivery device, and data analysis. The methodology can be used to characterize the ligand-recognition properties of most olfactory sensory neurons and the role of olfactory receptors (and other molecular components) in signal transduction."

Although the protonation state of the nucleophilic 2'-hydroxyl group is a critical determinant of the rate of RNA cleavage, the precise geometry of the chemical groups that comprise each internucleotide linkage also has a significant impact on cleavage activity. Specifically, transesterification is expected to be proportional to the relative in-line character of the linkage. We have examined the rates of spontaneous cleavage of various RNAs for which the secondary and tertiary structures have previously been modeled using either NMR or X-ray crystallographic data. Rate constants determined for the spontaneous cleavage of different RNA linkages vary by almost 10,000-fold, most likely reflecting the contribution that secondary and tertiary structures make towards the overall chemical stability of RNA. Moreover, a correlation is observed between RNA cleavage rate and the relative in-line fitness of each internucleotide linkage. One linkage located within an ATP-binding RNA aptamer is predicted to adopt most closely the ideal conformation for in-line attack. This linkage has a rate constant for transesterification that is approximately 12-fold greater than is observed for an unconstrained linkage and was found to be the most labile among a total of 136 different sites examined. The implications of this relationship for the chemical stability of RNA and for the mechanisms of nucleases and ribozymes are discussed."
A gene with homology to the myc similarity region of MyoD1 is expressed during myogenesis and is sufficient to activate the muscle differentiation program.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.5.628,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/5/628,3,5,05/01/1989,628,640,"['D G Edmondson', 'E N Olson']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']","MyoD1 is a nuclear phosphoprotein that is expressed in skeletal muscle in vivo and in certain muscle cell lines in vitro; it has been shown to convert fibroblasts to myoblasts through a mechanism requiring a domain with homology to the myc family of proteins. The BC3H1 muscle cell line expresses skeletal muscle-specific genes upon exposure to mitogen-deficient medium, but does not express MyoD1 at detectable levels. To determine whether BC3H1 cells may express regulatory genes functionally related to MyoD1, a cDNA library prepared from differentiated BC3H1 myocytes, was screened at reduced stringency with the region of the MyoD1 cDNA that shares homology with c-myc. From this screen, a cDNA was identified that encodes a major open reading frame with 72% homology to the myc domain and basic region of MyoD1. The mRNA encoded by this MyoD1-related gene is expressed in skeletal muscle in vivo and in differentiated skeletal myocytes in vitro and is undetectable in cardiac or smooth muscle, nonmuscle tissues, or nonmyogenic cell types. During myogenesis, the MyoD1-related mRNA accumulates several hours prior to other muscle-specific mRNAs and therefore represents an early molecular marker for entry of myoblasts into the differentiation pathway. Transient transfection of 10T1/2 or 3T3 cells with the MyoD1-related cDNA is sufficient to induce myosin heavy-chain expression and to activate a reporter gene under transcriptional control of the muscle creatine kinase 5' enhancer, which functions only in differentiated myocytes. Expression of this cDNA in stably transfected 10T1/2 cells also leads to fusion and muscle-specific gene expression upon exposure to mitogen-deficient medium. Thus, the product of this MyoD1-related gene is sufficient to activate the muscle differentiation program and may substitute for MyoD1 in certain developmental situations. Together, these results suggest the existence of a family of myogenic regulatory genes that share a conserved motif with c-myc."

Recently, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to show that Mg2+-dependent tertiary interactions force secondary structure rearrangement in the 56-nt tP5abc RNA, a truncated subdomain of the Tetrahymena group I intron. Here we combine mutagenesis with folding computations, nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, high-resolution NMR spectroscopy, and chemical-modification experiments to probe further the energetic interplay of tertiary and secondary interactions in tP5abc. Point mutations predicted to destabilize the secondary structure of folded tP5abc greatly disrupt its Mg2+-dependent folding, as monitored by nondenaturing gels. Imino proton assignments and sequential NOE walks of the two-dimensional NMR spectrum of one of the tP5abc mutants confirm the predicted secondary structure, which does not change in the presence of Mg2+. In contrast to these data on tP5abc, the same point mutations in the context of the P4-P6 domain (of which P5abc is a subdomain) shift the Mg2+ dependence of P4-P6 folding only moderately, and dimethyl sulfate (DMS) modification experiments demonstrate that Mg2+ does cause secondary structure rearrangement of the P4-P6 mutants' P5abc subdomains. Our data provide experimental support for two simple conclusions: (1) Even single point mutations at bases involved only in secondary structure can be enough to tip the balance between RNA tertiary and secondary interactions. (2) Domain context must be considered in evaluating the relative importance of tertiary and secondary contributions. This tertiary/secondary interplay is likely relevant to the folding of many large RNA and to bimolecular snRNA-snRNA and snRNA-intron RNA interactions."

The test animal was held in a fixed orientation at the center of a wing-beat processor that converts attempted turns into counter-rotations of a surrounding cylindrical panorama. This allowed the fly to maneuver the preferred object into the actual direction of flight. Single flies were trained to avoid a course toward the visual object that had been associated with the aversive odor benzaldehyde (BAL). Conditioned object avoidance was investigated in different treatment groups by collective evaluation of the scores from 80 long-lasting flights (> 1 hr). In addition to a significant cross-modal association, we found a striking long-term effect of transient exposure to BAL both in the embryonic and larval states. The preimaginal experience significantly increased the indifference to BAL in the adult flies. Disturbed vision does not account for this effect: Neither the perception nor the discrimination of the visual objects was significantly impaired in the investigated flies. Disturbed olfaction could explain the present results. Recently, however, preimaginal BAL uptake has been found to interfere directly with the retention of heat-shock-conditioned object avoidance."
Isolation and characterization of pre-mRNA splicing mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.8.1206,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/8/1206,3,8,08/01/1989,1206,1216,"['U Vijayraghavan', 'M Company', 'J Abelson']","['Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 91125.']","In this study we report the isolation of temperature-sensitive mutants that affect pre-mRNA splicing. A bank of approximately 1000 temperature-sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains was generated and screened on RNA gel blots by hybridization with an actin intron probe. We isolated 16 mutants defining 11 new complementation groups prp(rna)17-prp(rna)27 with four phenotypic classes of mutants and 21 mutants in the prp2-prp11 complementation groups (formerly rna2-rna11). The majority of the complementation groups share a phenotype of pre-mRNA accumulation, seen in all of the prp(rna)2-prp(rna)11 mutants. Three novel classes of mutants were isolated in this study. One class, consisting of two complementation groups, exhibits an accumulation of the lariat intermediate of splicing, with no change in the levels of pre-mRNA. The second class, also represented by two complementation groups, shows an accumulation of the intron released after splicing. The third novel class, comprising one complementation group, accumulates both pre-mRNA and the released intron. All mutants isolated were recessive for the splicing phenotype. Only 2 of the 11 complementation groups, although recessive, were not temperature sensitive. This study, together with previous isolation of the prp(rna)2-prp(rna)11 groups and the spliceosomal snRNAs, puts at least 26 gene products involved directly or indirectly in pre-mRNA splicing."

The presence of circulating-tumor DNA (ctDNA) has recently been reported to be strongly predictive of poor outcome in similar patient groups. We monitored ctDNA levels from 10 women undergoing NAC for locally advanced breast cancer using a patient-specific, hybrid-capture sequencing technique sensitive to the level of one altered allele in 10,000. Plasma was collected prior to the start of NAC, prior to each infusion of NAC, and during follow-up for between 350 and 1150 d after the start of NAC. Prior to the start of NAC, ctDNA was detectable in 3/3 triple negative, 3/3 HER2 + , and 2/4 HER2 − , ER + breast cancer patients. Total cell-free DNA levels were considerably higher when patients were on NAC than at other times. ctDNA dynamics during NAC showed that patients with pCR experienced rapid declines in ctDNA levels, whereas patients without pCR typically showed evidence of residual ctDNA after initiation of treatment. Intriguingly, two of three patients that showed marked increases in ctDNA while on NAC experienced rapid recurrences (<2 yr following start of NAC). The third patient that had increases in ctDNA levels while on NAC had low-grade ER + disease and showed residual ctDNA after surgery, which became undetectable after local radiation. Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability of our approach to sensitively serially monitor ctDNA during NAC, and identifies a need to further investigate the possibility of stratifying patients who need additional treatment or identify therapies that are ineffective."

Amyloids are usually associated with disease including Alzheimer's. However, amyloid has many useful features. It efficiently transforms protein from the soluble to the insoluble state in an essentially two-state process, while its repetitive structure provides high stability and a robust prion-like replication mechanism. Accordingly, amyloid is used by nature in multifaceted and ingenious ways of life, ranging from bacteria and fungi to mammals. These include (1) Structure: Templating for small chemical molecules (Pmel17), biofilm formation in bacteria (curli), assisting aerial hyphae formation in streptomycetes (chaplins) or monolayer formation at a surface (hydrophobins). (2) Reservoirs: A storage state for peptide/proteins to protect them from their surroundings or vice versa (storage of peptide hormones in mammalian secretory granules or major basic protein in eosinophils). (3) Information carriers: The fungal immune system (HET-s prion in Podospora anserina , yeast prions) or long-term memory (e.g., mnemons in yeast, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein in aplysia). Aggregation is also used to (4) “suppress” the function of the soluble protein (e.g., Cdc19 in yeast stress granules), or (5) “signaling” through formation of oligomers (e.g., HET-s prion, necroptosis-related proteins RIP1/RIP3). This review summarizes current knowledge on functional amyloids with a focus on the amyloid systems curli in bacteria, HET-s prion in P. anserina , and peptide hormone storage in mammals together with an attempt to highlight differences between functional and disease-associated amyloids."

Conversely, the technobiology approach that exploits advanced engineering to control underlying molecular mechanisms to recover biosystem’s energy states at the molecular level as well as at the level of the entire network of cells (i.e., the internet of the human body) is still in its early research stage.

Aberrant mRNAs with extended 3' UTRs are substrates for rapid degradation by mRNA surveillance.,RNA,RNA,1355-8382,1469-9001,,http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/5/10/1299,5,10,10/01/1999,1299,1307,"['D Muhlrad', 'R Parker']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721, USA.']","The mRNA surveillance system is known to rapidly degrade aberrant mRNAs that contain premature termination codons in a process referred to as nonsense-mediated decay. A second class of aberrant mRNAs are those wherein the 3' UTR is abnormally extended due to a mutation in the polyadenylation site. We provide several observations that these abnormally 3'-extended mRNAs are degraded by the same machinery that degrades mRNAs with premature nonsense codons. First, the decay of the 3'-extended mRNAs is dependent on the same decapping enzyme and 5'-to-3' exonuclease. Second, the decay is also dependent on the proteins encoded by the UPF1, UPF2, and UPF3 genes, which are known to be specifically required for the rapid decay of mRNAs containing nonsense codons. Third, the ability of an extended 3' UTR to trigger decay is prevented by stabilizing sequences within the PGK1 coding region that are known to protect mRNAs from the rapid decay induced by premature nonsense codons. These results indicate that the mRNA surveillance system plays a role in degrading abnormally extended 3' UTRs. Based on these results, we propose a model in which the mRNA surveillance machinery degrades aberrant mRNAs due to the absence of the proper spatial arrangement of the translation-termination codon with respect to the 3' UTR element as defined by the utilization of a polyadenylation site."

Using our design, a dual-trap optical tweezers with differential detection, we can detect length changes to a DNA molecule tethering the trapped beads of 1 bp. By forming two traps from the same laser and maximizing the common optical paths of the two trapping beams, we decouple the instrument from many sources of environmental and instrumental noise that typically limit spatial resolution. The performance of a high-resolution instrument--the formation of strong traps, the minimization of background signals from trap movements, or the mitigation of the axial coupling, for example--can be greatly improved through careful alignment. This procedure, which is described in this article, starts from the laser and advances through the instrument, component by component. Alignment is complicated by the fact that the trapping light is in the near infrared (NIR) spectrum. Standard infrared viewing cards are commonly used to locate the beam, but unfortunately, bleach quickly. As an alternative, we use an IR-viewing charge-coupled device (CCD) camera equipped with a C-mount telephoto lens and display its image on a monitor. By visualizing the scattered light on a pair of irises of identical height separated by >12 in., the beam direction can be set very accurately along a fixed axis."

The structure of PTF1 was elucidated by cross-linking purified PTF1 to DNA templates that had been differentially substituted with azido-deoxyuridine (N3.dU). This site-directed UV cross-linking shows that PTF1 contains two DNA-binding proteins, distinct in size and sensitivity to Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. A 64-kD protein is cross-linked with DNA containing N3.dU substitutions in the A box, and a 48-kD protein is cross-linked with DNA containing N3.dU substitutions in the B box. Both proteins bind simultaneously to the same DNA molecule. The data indicate that PTF1 is a heteromeric oligomer and that its cell-specific DNA-binding potential is the result of a concerted activity of two DNA-binding subunits."

Slugs were first conditioned to avoid carrot odor and then a second conditioning procedure was applied 1, 3, 6, or 7 days after the first conditioning trial. Cooling the slugs to approximately 1 degrees C on day 7 immediately after the presentation of the odor used in the conditioning resulted in retrograde amnesia in the slugs that were subject to a second conditioning on day 6 or 7, but not in slugs that were subject to a second conditioning on day 1 or 3. Next, second-order conditioning was used as the second conditioning procedure to distinguish the memory acquired in the first conditioning from that acquired in the second conditioning and similar results were obtained. These results suggest that the reactivation of memory altered the memory state from a cooling-insensitive state to a cooling-sensitive one. A possible model for memory states is discussed."

They are inserted cotranslationally into the prokaryotic plasma membrane or eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The Sec61 complex (SecY complex in prokaryotes) provides a ribosome docking site, houses a channel across the membrane, and contains a lateral gate that opens toward the lipid bilayer. Model multipass proteins can be stitched into the membrane by iteratively using Sec61's lateral gate for TMD insertion and its central pore for translocation of flanking domains. Native multipass proteins, with their diverse TMDs and complex topologies, often also rely on members of the Oxa1 family of translocation factors, the PAT complex chaperone, and other poorly understood factors. Here, we discuss the mechanisms of TMD insertion, highlight the limitations of an iterative insertion model, and propose a new hypothesis for multipass membrane protein biogenesis based on recent findings."

The control of gene expression that is necessary to survive in these two environments operates almost exclusively at the posttranscriptional level, and the sequences responsible are located in the 3' untranslated regions of the mRNAs. The major surface proteins of procyclic trypanosomes, EP1, EP2, EP3, and GPEET, are not expressed in bloodstream forms. The 3' untranslated regions of these four mRNAs are not very similar, but all contain a conserved 26mer sequence that is required for developmental regulation. We have analyzed the conformation of the EP1 3' UTR in vitro by enzymatic digestion and lead hydrolysis, and in vivo by modification with DMS and with CMCT (introduced by electroporation). Results indicate that the 3' UTR can be divided into three domains. Domains I and III, at the 5' and 3' ends, form stable structures, but the central domain (domain II), which includes the 26mer, has no stable interactions either within itself, or with other parts of the 3' UTR. Domain I contains three leadzymes that do not conform to the previously reported consensus."

We sought to determine whether the virus involved in this rare case had any unusual features that may have contributed to the dire patient outcome. A pregnant woman with negative HerpeSelect antibody test underwent cesarean section at 30 wk gestation and died the same day. The premature newborn died 5 d later. Both individuals were found postmortem to have positive blood HSV-1 PCR tests. Using oligonucleotide enrichment and deep sequencing, we determined that viral transmission from mother to infant was nearly perfect at the consensus genome level. At the virus population level, 77% of minor variants (MVs) in the mother's blood also appeared on the neonate's skin, of which more than half were disseminated into the neonate's blood. We also detected nonmaternal MVs that arose de novo in the neonate's viral populations. Of note, one de novo MV in the neonate's skin virus induced a nonsynonymous mutation in the UL6 protein, which is a component of the portal that allows DNA entry into new progeny capsids. This case suggests that perinatal viremic HSV-1 transmission includes the majority of genetic diversity from the maternal virus population and that new, nonsynonymous mutations can occur after relatively few rounds of replication. This report expands our understanding of viral transmission in humans and may lead to improved diagnostic strategies for neonatal HSV-1 acquisition."

This latter phenomenon is known as ""splicing thermotolerance"". In this article we demonstrate that the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) are in vivo targets of thermal damage within the splicing apparatus in heat-shocked yeast cells. Following a heat shock, levels of the tri-snRNP (U4/U6.U5), free U6 snRNP, and a pre-U6 snRNP complex are dramatically reduced. In addition, we observe multiple alterations in U1, U2, U5, and U4/U6 snRNP profiles and the accumulation of precursor forms of U4- and U6-containing snRNPs. Reassembly of snRNPs following a heat shock is correlated with the recovery of mRNA splicing and requires both Hsp104 and the Ssa Hsp70 family of proteins. Furthermore, we correlate splicing thermotolerance with the protection of a subset of snRNPs by Ssa proteins but not Hsp104, and show that Hsp70 directly associates with U4- and U6-containing snRNPs in splicing thermotolerant cells. In addition, our results show that Hsp70 plays a role in snRNP assembly under normal physiological conditions."

Lanes and lane boundaries are tracked by analyzing a first difference approximation to the gradient of a vertically integrated and processed ""brightness"" profile. Initially lanes are located in a region of the gel image selected for good horizontal lane spacing and signal strength. The software uses models of expected lane and interlane spacing and lateral lane behavior to maintain accurate tracking on imperfect gels. In areas where intensity-based tracking is difficult, interpixel column correlation is also used to locate and define lane features. Summary statistics and compressed-in-time images are generated for user evaluation of tracking performance. The software developed has been tested successfully on gel images with degradations including significant horizontal lane motion (curving) and image artifacts, and is now in full-scale use in our sequencing projects."
A simple and efficient method to reduce nontemplated nucleotide addition at the 3 terminus of RNAs transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase.,RNA,RNA,1355-8382,1469-9001,,http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/5/9/1268,5,9,09/01/1999,1268,1272,"['C Kao', 'M Zheng', 'S Rüdisser']","['Department of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington 47405, USA. ckao@bio.indiana.edu']",DNA templates modified with C2'-methoxyls at the last two nucleotides of the 5' termini dramatically reduced nontemplated nucleotide addition by the T7 RNA polymerase from both single- and double-stranded DNA templates.

Transcripts produced from the modified templates can be purified with greater ease and should be useful in a number of applications.

We investigated the declarative memory of two rare patients with selective bilateral amygdala damage. Both subjects showed impairments in long-term declarative memory for emotionally arousing material. The data support the hypothesis that the human amygdala normally enhances acquisition of declarative knowledge regarding emotionally arousing stimuli."

Analysis of the pedigree data reveal that all of these individuals traced back to a single acknowledged carrier founder individual. Between seven and nine generations separated the founder from its 12 affected descendents. The 12 affected offspring were genotyped for a battery of 213 microsatellites spanning the 29 bovine autosomes. The resulting genotypes were analyzed using a maximum likelihood approach searching for shared homozygous haplotypes among affected individuals. Three candidate regions for the syndactyly locus emerged from this initial screening. syndactyly was shown to map to one of these candidate regions on chromosome 15 by genotyping 29 additional individuals linking founder and affected offspring and performing a conventional linkage analysis with the LINKAGE programs. This study illustrates the potential of identity-by-descent mapping in livestock populations.

We have previously shown that human PRPF39 forms a homodimer that interacts with the CTD of U1C, mirroring the yeast Prp39/Prp42 heterodimer. We demonstrate here that PRPF39 knockdown in HEK293 cells affects many alternative splicing events primarily by reducing the usage of weak 5′ ss. Additionally, PRPF39 preferentially binds to a GC-rich RNA, likely at the interface between its NTD and CTD. These data indicate that PRPF39 potentially recruits U1 snRNP to a weak 5′ ss, serving as a previously unrecognized alternative splicing factor. We further demonstrate that human TIA1 binds to U1C through its RRM1 and RRM3 + Q domains and has weak binding to PRPF39. Finally, all three human LUC7L isoforms directly interact with U1C and with PRPF39. These results reveal significant parallels to the yeast U1 snRNP structure and support the use of yeast U1 snRNP as a model for understanding the mechanism of human alternative splicing."
Late-onset pattern macular dystrophy mimicking ABCA4 and PRPH2 disease is caused by a homozygous frameshift mutation in ROM1,Molecular Case Studies,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud,,2373-2873,10.1101/mcs.a003624,http://molecularcasestudies.cshlp.org/content/5/3/a003624,5,3,06/01/2019,a003624,,"['Chu Jian Ma', 'Winston Lee', 'Nicholas Stong', 'Jana Zernant', 'Stanley Chang', 'David Goldstein', 'Takayuki Nagasaki', 'Rando Allikmets']","['Department of Ophthalmology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA', 'Institute of Genomic Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA']","ROM1 (retinal outer segment membrane protein 1) is a 351-amino acid integral membrane protein on Chromosome 11q, with high structural similarity to PRPH2/RDS. Localized at the rims of photoreceptor outer segments (OSs), it is required for the maintenance of OS structure. Here, we describe a case with a phenotypic manifestation of a homozygous single-base pair deletion, c.712delC (p.Leu238Cysfs*78) in the ROM1 gene, resulting in early termination at exon 2. The variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a 63-yr-old Caucasian woman with late-onset pattern macular dystrophy. Notably, although the phenotype resembles those caused by pathogenic variants in ABCA4 or RDS/PRPH2 , no pathogenic variants in these, or any other plausible candidate genes, were identified by WES. Clinical features include the presence of hyperautofluorescent flecks, relative sparing of the central macula, and preserved visual acuity. Reduced visual sensitivity was detected among flecked regions in the retina; however, full-field electroretinogram testing revealed no generalized cone dysfunction. The described first case of the complete loss of ROM1 protein function in the retina suggests its sufficiency for late-onset macular dystrophy. ROM1 and PRPH2 pattern macular dystrophies exhibit phenotype overlap, which may be attributable to their shared role in maintenance of the photoreceptor outer segment structure."

The number, type, and connectivity patterns of synapses determine the formation, maintenance, and function of neural circuitries. The complexity and specificity of synaptogenesis relies upon modulation of adhesive properties, which regulate contact initiation, synapse formation, maturation, and functional plasticity. Disruption of adhesion may result in structural and functional imbalance that may lead to neurodevelopmental diseases, such as autism, or neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, understanding the roles of different adhesion protein families in synapse formation is crucial for unraveling the biology of neuronal circuit formation, as well as the pathogenesis of some brain disorders.

DC0X4 hemizygotes died as third-instar larvae at 18 degrees C, the restrictive temperature, but were viable when raised at 25 degrees C. Shifting adult DC0X4 hemizygotes from 25 degrees C to 18 degrees C led to a decrease in PKA activity from 24% to 16% of wild-type without impairing viability. At 25 degrees C, DC0X4 hemizygotes exhibited reduced initial learning relative to controls but normal memory decay in a Pavlovian olfactory learning assay. Shifting the temperature from 25 degrees C to 18 degrees C prior to training reduced initial learning to a similar extent in DC0X4 hemizygotes and controls but resulted in a steeper memory decay curve only in DC0X4 hemizygotes. These observations are suggestive of a role for PKA in medium-term memory formation in addition to its previously established role in initial learning."

The replacement of the viral leader by a series of short, low-energy stems in either orientation supports efficient ribosomal shunting, showing that the stem per se, and not its sequence, is recognized by the translation machinery. The requirement for cis-acting sequences from the unstructured terminal regions of the viral leader was analyzed: the 5'-terminal polypyrimidine stretch and the short upstream open reading frame (uORF) A stimulate translation, whereas the 3'-flanking region seems not to be essential. Based on these results, an artificial leader was designed with a stable stem flanked by unstructured sequences derived from parts of the 5'- and 3'-proximal regions of the CaMV 35S RNA leader. This artificial leader is shunt-competent in translation assays in vivo and in vitro, indicating that a low-energy stem, broadly used as a device to successfully interfere with ribosome scanning, can efficiently support translation, if preceded by a short uORF. The synthetic 140-nt leader can functionally replace the CaMV 35S RNA 600-nt leader, thus implicating the universal role that nonlinear ribosome scanning could play in translation initiation in eukaryotes."

Because any pair of the three domains is sufficient to direct pancreas-specific expression in mice, no one domain is required for pancreas-specific transcription. Disruption of any two domains does inactivate the enhancer function in transgenic mice. Therefore, the elastase I enhancer domains essential for function in transfected cells in culture are not essential in animals but have a redundant function not apparent in transfected cells. This redundant function is not because of the particular acinar cell line used for transfections, the nature of the reporter gene, or the state of integration of the foreign test gene.

Deoxyribonucleoside substitutions revealed that a 2'-hydroxyl group (2'-OH) is required only on the guanosine occupying the third residue of the RNA triplets for high-affinity binding to TRAP. The remaining hydroxyl groups are dispensable. Base analog substitutions identified all of the exocyclic functional groups and N1 nitrogens of adenine and guanine in the second and third nucleotides, respectively, of the triplets as being involved in binding TRAP. In contrast, none of the substitutions made in the first residue caused any detectable changes in affinity, indicating that elements of these bases are not necessary for complex formation and stability. Studies using abasic nucleotides in the first residue of the triplets and in the two spacer residues confirmed that the majority of the specificity and stability of the TRAP-RNA complex is provided by the AG dinucleotide of the triplet repeats. In addition to direct effects on binding, we demonstrate that the N7-nitrogen of adenosine and guanosine in UAG triplet and the 2'-OHs of (UAGCC)11 RNA are involved in the formation of an as yet undetermined structure that interferes with TRAP binding."

Therefore, we investigated the expression of Vgr-1 and BMP-2a RNAs in embryonic, newborn, and adult tissues by in situ hybridization. Vgr-1 RNA is maternally encoded in ovarian oocytes but declines in fertilized eggs and is undectable by the two- to four-cell stage. Only low levels of transcripts are seen in blastocysts and early postimplantation stages. From mid-gestation on, Vgr-1 RNA is expressed at high levels in developing skin, especially in the suprabasal cells of the proliferating epidermis but not in the dermis or hair follicles, both of which contain TGF beta 1 and/or TGF beta 2 RNAs. In contrast, BMP-2a transcripts are seen only in the hair follicles in the cells of the hair bulb cortex. Temporally and spatially distinct patterns of BMP-2a, Vgr-1, TGF beta 1, and TGF beta 2 expression are also seen in different populations of mesenchymal cells in the developing skeletal system (cartilage and bone).

Fresh primary and recurrent tumor samples were collected and processed for patient-derived model development. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed concurrently with additional standard of care diagnostics. WGS revealed a hypermutated genotype in the germline tissue and in both the primary and recurrent tumor samples. Specific to the matched tumors, an average of 30 cancer driver genes were mutated. Noteworthy was the identification of a nonsynonymous mutation in the POLE gene. As a possible instigator of the hypermutational genotype observed in the tumors, we identified nonsynonymous germline mutations within the mismatch repair genes, MLH1 and PMS2 . Mutations within these genes are often indicative of the pan-cancer phenotype known as Lynch syndrome; however, their pathogenicity remains unreported. We performed a drug screen of 165 compounds, which identified one compound, YM155, an experimental survivin inhibitor, that showed effectivity to the patient-derived cell lines of both tumors. Treatment selection based on a patient's genome to individualize treatment for GBM patients could potentially be useful in the clinic. This is a promising avenue for further translational research, with larger databases and integrated platforms to increase the efficiency of analyzing and interpreting the individual genomic data of GBM."

One type of ancillary data that can contribute to establishing these overlaps is DNA sequence data derived from the ends of large (> 30 kb) inserts in genomic clones. This type of data can be difficult to obtain routinely, because large clones are often unstable and microgram quantities of highly purified DNA are required in each sequencing reaction to obtain sufficient signal for accurate base calling and maximum read length. Recently, we have been experimenting with methods to consistently obtain up to 800 bases of high-quality sequence data from the ends of large insert clones using ThermoSequenase DNA polymerase and Energy Transfer fluorescent primers. Our experimental approach and results, described in this paper, indicate that routinely obtaining high-quality sequence data from the ends of large insert genomic clones is feasible. Such data can contribute to the assessment of common regions between large insert clones, to the establishment of conservation of synteny between closely related species, and to the detection of additional contiguous clones."
A developmental-specific factor binds to suppressor sites flanking the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.8.1255,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/8/1255,3,8,08/01/1989,1255,1266,"['R H Scheuermann', 'U Chen']","['Basel Institute for Immunology, Switzerland.']","We identified a novel nuclear protein, NF-mu NR, that binds to multiple sites flanking the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer. The expression of NF-mu NR shows a unique developmental pattern; the activity is present in all cells representing early stages of B-cell development, but is absent from more mature cells that express a high level of immunoglobulin heavy chains. NF-mu NR also is present in most cell lines outside of the B-cell lineage (e.g., T cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts). The binding sites for NF-mu NR correlate very well with cis-acting negative regulatory elements of the heavy-chain enhancer defined previously. Indeed, when the segments bound by NF-mu NR are deleted from the enhancer, it is now found to function as a positive transcription element in T cells and macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest that NF-mu NR may function as a negative regulator of enhancer function. The observation that the segments bound by NF-mu NR correspond to the segments bound to the nuclear matrix suggests an intriguing model not only of how enhancers might function but also of how negative regulation might occur."
The Signaling Mechanisms Underlying Cell Polarity and Chemotaxis,Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol,,1943-0264,10.1101/cshperspect.a002980,http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/1/4/a002980,1,4,10/01/2009,a002980,,['Fei Wang'],"['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology and Institute for Genomic Biology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801']",Chemotaxis—the directed movement of cells in a gradient of chemoattractant—is essential for neutrophils to crawl to sites of inflammation and infection and for Dictyostelium discoideum ( D. discoideum ) to aggregate during morphogenesis. Chemoattractant-induced activation of spatially localized cellular signals causes cells to polarize and move toward the highest concentration of the chemoattractant. Extensive studies have been devoted to achieving a better understanding of the mechanism(s) used by a neutrophil to choose its direction of polarity and to crawl effectively in response to chemoattractant gradients. Recent technological advances are beginning to reveal many fascinating details of the intracellular signaling components that spatially direct the cytoskeleton of neutrophils and D. discoideum and the complementary mechanisms that make the cell's front distinct from its back.
Regulation of endogenous retrovirus–derived regulatory elements by GATA2/3 and MSX2 in human trophoblast stem cells,Genome Research,Genome Res.,1088-9051,1549-5469,10.1101/gr.277150.122,https://genome.cshlp.org/content/33/2/197,33,2,02/01/2023,197,207,"['Cui Du', 'Jing Jiang', 'Yuzhuo Li', 'Miao Yu', 'Jian Jin', 'Shuai Chen', 'Hairui Fan', 'Todd S.

Recent evidence suggests that numerous human placental enhancers are evolved from lineage-specific insertions of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), yet the transcription factors (TFs) underlying their regulation remain largely elusive. Here, by first focusing on MER41, a primate-specific ERV family previously linked to placenta and innate immunity, we uncover the binding motifs of multiple crucial trophoblast TFs (GATA2/3, MSX2, GRHL2) in addition to innate immunity TFs STAT1 and IRF1. Integration of ChIP-seq data confirms the binding of GATA2/3, MSX2, and their related factors on the majority of MER41-derived enhancers in human trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). MER41-derived enhancers that are constitutively active in human TSCs are distinct from those activated upon interferon stimulation, which is determined by the binding of relevant TFs and their subfamily compositions. We further demonstrate that GATA2/3 and MSX2 have prevalent binding to numerous other ERV families — indicating their broad impact on ERV-derived enhancers. Functionally, the derepression of many syncytiotrophoblast genes after MSX2 knockdown is likely to be mediated by regulatory elements derived from ERVs — suggesting ERVs are also important for mediating transcriptional repression. Overall, this study characterizes the regulation of ERV-derived regulatory elements by GATA2/3, MSX2, and their cofactors in human TSCs, and provides mechanistic insights into the importance of ERVs in human trophoblast regulatory network."

This homeo box is related in sequence to Abdominal-B, a Drosophila homeotic gene that specifies identity of posterior segments. An antibody probe was made using a human Hox-5.2 fusion protein and was found to stain posterior regions of mouse, chicken, and Xenopus embryos. Unexpectedly, when the distribution of Hox-5.2 antigen was compared with that of X1Hbox 1 antigen, a non-overlapping and mutually exclusive pattern was detected (e.g., in developing limb buds, intestine, and somites). Regions expressing Hox-5.2 do not express X1Hbox 1 protein, and vice versa. Hox-5.2 antigen is detected strongly in developing fore- and hindlimb buds, where it forms a gradient of nuclear protein throughout most of the mesenchyme. This gradient is maximal in distal and posterior regions. Hox-5.2 expression is activated in Xenopus limb regeneration blastemas, as expected for any gene involved in pattern formation. As described previously, a gradient of X1Hbox 1 protein can be detected in the forelimb. The latter gradient has the opposite polarity to that of Hox-5.2. i.e., maximal in anterior and proximal mesoderm. These two opposing gradients (and possibly others) could be involved in determining positional values in developing limb buds."

In this study, we have confirmed that human DNMT1 indeed interacts with multiple RNAs, including its own nuclear mRNA. Unexpectedly, we found that DNMT1 exhibits a strong and specific affinity for GU-rich RNAs that form a pUG-fold, a noncanonical G-quadruplex. We find that pUG-fold-capable RNAs inhibit DNMT1 activity by inhibiting binding of hemimethylated DNA, and we additionally provide evidence for multiple RNA binding modes with DNMT1. Together, our data indicate that a human chromatin-associated protein binds to and is regulated by pUG-fold RNA."

Molecular characterization of this cancer remains limited. We present a case of an adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) in a 37-yr-old female, with dual lung metastases identified 1 yr following commencement of adjuvant mitotane therapy. As standard therapeutic regimens are often unsuccessful in ACC, we undertook a comprehensive genomic study into this case to identify treatment options and monitor disease progress. We performed targeted and whole-genome sequencing of germline, primary tumor, and both metastatic tumors from this patient and monitored recurrence over 2 years using liquid biopsy for ctDNA and steroid hormone measurements. Sequencing revealed the primary and metastatic tumors were hyperhaploid, with extensive loss of heterozygosity but few structural rearrangements. Loss-of-function mutations were identified in MSH2 , TP53 , RB1 , and PTEN , resulting in tumors with mismatch repair signatures and microsatellite instability. At the cellular level, tumors were populated by mitochondria-rich oncocytes. Longitudinal ctDNA mutation and hormone profiles were unable to detect micrometastatic disease, consistent with clinical indicators of disease remission. The molecular signatures in our ACC case suggested immunotherapy in the event of disease progression; however, the patient remains free of cancer. The extensive molecular analysis presented here could be applied to other rare and/or poorly stratified cancers to identify novel or repurpose existing therapeutic options, thereby broadly improving diagnoses, treatments, and prognoses."

Given the large social and welfare burden that results from ARHL, and because ARHL is potentially a modifiable risk factor for dementia, there is an urgent need for therapeutic interventions to ameliorate age-related auditory decline. However, a prerequisite for design of therapies is knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms. Currently, our understanding of ARHL is very limited.

We outline early works on human RNase P as a tRNA processing enzyme and comment on its expanding nonconventional functions in molecular networks of transcription, chromatin remodeling, homology-directed repair, and innate immunity. The important implications and insights from these discoveries on the potential use of RNase P as a gene-targeting tool are presented. This multifunctionality calls to a modified structure–function partitioning of domains in human RNase P, as well as its relative ribonucleoprotein, RNase MRP. The role of these two catalysts in innate immunity is of particular interest in molecular evolution, as this dynamic molecular network could have originated and evolved from primordial enzymes and sensors of RNA, including predecessors of these two ribonucleoproteins."

However, about two-thirds of the disease genes remain uncloned. The region around the polymorphic DXS52 locus (ST14) within Xq28 lies in the candidate regions for several as-yet-uncloned disease genes. So far, only four melanoma antigen genes (MAGE) and the human biglycan (BGN) gene, have been mapped within the 700-kb stretch around DXS52, suggesting that more genes may reside in this region. By combining exon trapping and direct cDNA selection methods, we sought to identify novel transcripts around the DXS52 locus. In addition to recovering the MAGE and BGN genes, we isolated and mapped six putative novel genes (XAP103-XAP108), the caltractin gene, and a gene encoding a novel Ca(2+)-transporting ATPase isoform (hPMCA5). The newly isolated sequences were considered as representing parts of putative genes if they contained at least one unique exon-trap product and/or at least one expressed sequence tag (EST) from sequence data bases and if, in addition, they showed evidence of expressed RT-OCT and/or Northern blot analysis. Our data facilitated the integration of the transcription map with the physical map around the DXS52 locus.

Two recent studies have shown that this effect can be reversed in participants with highly disrupted sleep. To test whether weakening of reactivated memories can result directly from sleep disruption, in this experiment we varied the intensity of memory reactivation cues such that some produced sleep arousals. Prior to sleep, participants (local community members) learned the locations of 75 objects, each accompanied by a sound naturally associated with that object. Location recall was tested before and after sleep, and a subset of the sounds was presented during sleep to provoke reactivation of the corresponding locations. Reactivation with sleep arousal weakened memories, unlike the improvement typically found after reactivation without sleep arousal. We conclude that reactivated memories can be selectively weakened during sleep, and that memory reactivation may strengthen or weaken memories depending on additional factors such as concurrent sleep disruption."

Comparisons of the C. intestinalis genome and the related but divergent Ciona savignyi genome have facilitated the identification of conserved non-coding DNAs, including regulatory DNAs such as tissue-specific enhancers. Systematic in situ hybridization assays and gene-disruption experiments using specific morpholino antisense oligonucleotides have led to the elaboration of provisional gene regulatory networks underlying the specification of key chordate tissues, including the notochord, neural tube, and beating heart. These networks provide a foundation for understanding the mechanistic basis of more complex cell-specification processes in vertebrates, and for understanding the evolutionary origins of distinctive vertebrate characteristics such as the neural crest.

The model was produced by pharmacological inhibition of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) activity. In this model, coapplication of an activator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoform ERK and an activator of protein kinase A (PKA) resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of RSK and enhanced LTF to a greater extent than either drug alone and also greater than their additive effects, which is termed synergism. The extent of synergism appeared to depend on another MAPK isoform, p38 MAPK. Inhibition of p38 MAPK facilitated serotonin (5-HT)-induced RSK phosphorylation, indicating that p38 MAPK inhibits activation of RSK. Inhibition of p38 MAPK combined with activation of PKA synergistically activated both ERK and RSK. Our results suggest that cellular models of disorders that affect synaptic plasticity and learning, such as CLS, may constitute a useful strategy to identify candidate drug combinations, and that combining computational models with empirical tests of model predictions can help explain synergism of drug combinations."
Splicing factor SF1 from Drosophila and Caenorhabditis: presence of an N-terminal RS domain and requirement for viability.,RNA,RNA,1355-8382,1469-9001,,http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/5/12/1615,5,12,12/01/1999,1615,1631,"['R Mazroui', 'A Puoti', 'A Krämer']","['Département de Biologie Cellulaire, Université de Genève, Switzerland.']","Splicing factor SF1 contributes to the recognition of the 3' splice site by interacting with U2AF65 and binding to the intron branch site during the formation of the early splicing complex E. These interactions and the essential functional domains of SF1 are highly conserved in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have isolated cDNAs encoding SF1 from Drosophila (Dm) and Caenorhabditis (Ce). The encoded proteins share the U2AF65 interaction domain, a hnRNP K homology domain, and one or two zinc knuckles required for RNA binding as well as Pro-rich C-terminal sequences with their yeast and mammalian counterparts. In contrast to SF1 in other species, DmSF1 and CeSF1 are characterized by an N-terminal region enriched in Ser, Arg, Lys, and Asp residues with homology to the RS domains of several splicing proteins. These domains mediate protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions, suggesting an additional role for DmSF1 and CeSF1 in pre-mRNA splicing. Human (Hs), fly, and worm SF1 interact equally well with HsU2AF65 or the Drosophila homolog DmU2AF50. Moreover, DmSF1 lacking its N terminus is functional in prespliceosome formation in a HeLa splicing system, emphasizing the conserved nature of interactions at an early step in spliceosome assembly. The Ce-SF1 gene is located in a polycistronic transcription unit downstream of the genes encoding U2AF35 (uaf-2) and a cyclophilin (cyp-13), implying the coordinate transcriptional regulation of these genes. Injection of double-stranded RNA into C. elegans results in embryonic lethality; thus, the SF1 gene is essential not only in yeast but also in at least one metazoan."

Cellular and animal models for human cancer are also dealt with whenever appropriate. E-cadherin is the prototype of the large cadherin superfamily and is renowned for its potent malignancy suppressing activity. Different mechanisms for inactivating E-cadherin/CDH1 have been identified in human cancers: inherited and somatic mutations, aberrant protein processing, increased promoter methylation, and induction of transcriptional repressors such as Snail and ZEB family members. The latter induce epithelial mesenchymal transition, which is also associated with induction of “mesenchymal” cadherins, a hallmark of tumor progression. VE-cadherin/CDH5 plays a role in tumor-associated angiogenesis. The atypical T-cadherin/CDH13 is often silenced in cancer cells but up-regulated in tumor vasculature. The review also covers the status of protocadherins and several other cadherin-related molecules in human cancer. Perspectives for emerging cadherin-related anticancer therapies are given."

However, clinical courses vary widely, and recent studies suggest that molecular profiling of ALK + NSCLC can provide additional predictors of therapy response that could assist further individualization of patient management. As repeated tissue biopsies often pose technical difficulties and significant procedural risk, analysis of tumor constituents circulating in the blood, including ctDNA and various proteins, is increasingly recognized as an alternative method of tumor sampling (“liquid biopsy”). Here, we report the case of a KLC1–ALK -rearranged NSCLC patient responding to crizotinib treatment and demonstrate how analysis of plasma and serum biomarkers can be used to identify the ALK fusion partner and monitor therapy over time. Results of ctDNA sequencing and copy-number alteration profiling as well as serum protein concentrations at various time points during therapy reflected the current remission status and could predict the subsequent clinical course. At the time of disease progression, we identified four distinct secondary mutations in the ALK gene in ctDNA potentially causing treatment failure, accompanied by rising levels of CEA and CYFRA 21–1. Moreover, several copy-number variations were detected at the end of the treatment, including an amplification of a region on Chromosome 12 encompassing the TP53 regulator MDM2 . In summary, our findings illustrate the utility of noninvasive longitudinal molecular profiling for assessing remission status, exploring mechanisms of treatment failure, predicting subsequent clinical course, and dissecting dynamics of drug-resistant clones in ALK + lung cancer."

A highly curated human transcript data base was used as a reference data set of known genes. A detailed analysis of EST sequences derived from known genes was performed to assess the accuracy of EST sequence annotation. The EST data was screened to remove low-quality and low-complexity sequences. A set of high-quality ESTs similar to the transcript data base was identified using BLAST; this subset of ESTs was compared with the set of known genes using the Smith-Waterman algorithm. Error rates of several types were assessed based on a flexible match criterion defining sequence identity. The rate of lane-tracking errors is very low, approximately 0.5%. Insert size data is accurate within approximately 20%. Reversed clone and internal priming error rates are approximately 5% and 2.5%, respectively, contributing to the incorrect identification of reads as 3' ends of genes. Follow-up investigation reveals that a significant number of clones, miscategorized as reversed, represent overlapping genes on the opposite strand of entries in the transcript data base. Relevance of these results to the creation of a high-quality index to the human genome capable of supporting diverse genomic investigations is discussed."
In vivo PIWI slicing in mouse testes deviates from rules established in vitro,RNA,RNA,1355-8382,1469-9001,10.1261/rna.079349.122,http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/29/3/308,29,3,03/01/2023,308,316,"['Mark Dowling', 'David Homolka', 'Nicole Raad', 'Pascal Gos', 'Radha Raman Pandey', 'Ramesh S.

One cardinal rule that is structurally defined is the inability of slicers to cleave target RNAs when nucleotide mismatches exist between the paired small RNA and the target at the cleavage site. Animal-specific PIWI clade Argonautes associate with PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to silence transposable elements in the gonads, and this is essential for fertility. We previously demonstrated that purified endogenous mouse MIWI fails to cleave mismatched targets in vitro. Surprisingly, here we find using knock-in mouse models that target sites with cleavage-site mismatches at the 10th and 11th piRNA nucleotides are precisely sliced in vivo. This is identical to the slicing outcome in knock-in mice where targets are base-paired perfectly with the piRNA. Additionally, we find that pachytene piRNA-guided slicing in both these situations failed to initiate phased piRNA production from the specific target mRNA we studied. Instead, the two slicer cleavage fragments were retained in PIWI proteins as pre-piRNA and 17–19 nt by-product fragments. Our results indicate that PIWI slicing rules established in vitro are not respected in vivo, and that all targets of PIWI slicing are not substrates for piRNA biogenesis."
Distinct Gag interaction properties of HIV-1 RNA 5′ leader conformers reveal a mechanism for dimeric genome selection,RNA,RNA,1355-8382,1469-9001,10.1261/rna.079347.122,http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/29/2/217,29,2,02/01/2023,217,227,"['Xin Yang', 'Yong Liu', 'Wen Cui', 'Mengmeng Liu', 'Wei Wang']","['Institute of Life Sciences, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China', 'Office of Research Administration, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China']","During HIV-1 assembly, two copies of viral genomic RNAs (gRNAs) are selectively packaged into new viral particles. This process is mediated by specific interactions between HIV-1 Gag and the packaging signals at the 5′ leader (5′L) of viral gRNA. 5′L is able to adopt different conformations, which promotes either gRNA dimerization and packaging or Gag translation. Dimerization and packaging are coupled. Whether the selective packaging of the gRNA dimer is due to favorable interactions between Gag and 5′L in the packaging conformation is not known. Here, using RNAs mimicking the two 5′L conformers, we show that the 5′L conformation dramatically affects Gag–RNA interactions. Compared to the RNA in the translation conformation (5′L T ), the RNA in the packaging conformation (5′L P ) can bind more Gag molecules. Gag associates with 5′L P faster than it binds to 5′L T , whereas Gag dissociates from 5′L P more slowly. The Gag–5′L P complex is more stable at high salt concentrations. The NC–SP2–p6 region of Gag likely accounts for the faster association and slower dissociation kinetics for the Gag–5′L P interaction and for the higher stability. In summary, our data suggest that conformational changes play an important role in the selection of dimeric genomes, probably by affecting the binding kinetics and stability of the Gag–5′L complex."

Salt stress inhibits seed germination, retards plant growth, and accelerates senescence. Freezing or drought stress can cause cell damage and plant death. The following parameters can be used to evaluate plant tolerance to salt, drought, or freezing stress: root elongation (described here), fresh weight gain, seed germination, electrolyte leakage, or water loss measurement. Several stress mutants have been characterized using these tests, including hos1 and hos2 , which show higher expression of some stress-regulated genes when exposed to low-temperature stress; hos5 , which shows higher expression of some stress-regulated genes under abscisic acid (ABA) and salt treatments; sfr mutants, which are deficient in freezing tolerance; and eskimo1 , which is constitutively freezing-tolerant. To determine whether a mutant shows altered response to osmotic stress or to specific ions, various concentrations of salts can be used. Mannitol can also be used to impose osmotic stress, and ABA can be used to impose hormone stress. Among the salts used in this protocol, Li + is considered a toxic analog of Na + , whereas Cs + is a toxic cation related to K + . The levels of stress suggested in this protocol may need to be adjusted, depending on the ecotype and growth conditions used."

Using vertebrate embryos instead of cell-based assays has the advantage that the screening of small molecules occurs in the context of the complex biology and physiology of the whole organism. Fish and amphibians are the only classes of vertebrates with free-living larvae amenable to high-throughput drug screening in multiwell dishes. For both animal classes, particularly zebrafish and Xenopus , husbandry requirements are straightforward, embryos can be obtained in large numbers, and they develop ex utero so their development can be monitored easily with a dissecting microscope. At 350 million years, the evolutionary distance between amphibians and humans is significantly shorter than that between fish and humans, which is estimated at 450 million years. This increases the likelihood that drugs discovered by screening in amphibian embryos will be active in humans. Here, we describe the basic protocol for the medium- to high-throughput screening of chemical libraries using embryos of the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis . Bioactive compounds are identified by observing phenotypic changes in whole embryos and tadpoles. In addition to the discovery of compounds with novel bioactivities, the phenotypic screening protocol also allows for the identification of compounds with in vivo toxicity, eliminating early hits that are poor drug candidates. We also highlight important considerations for designing chemical screens, choosing chemical libraries, and performing secondary screens using whole mount in situ hybridization or immunostaining."

Here we introduce Aldy 4, a fast and efficient tool for genotyping pharmacogenes that uses combinatorial optimization for accurate star-allele calling across different sequencing technologies. Aldy 4 adds support for long reads and uses a novel phasing model and improved copy number and variant calling models. We compare Aldy 4 against the current state-of-the-art star-allele callers on a large and diverse set of samples and genes sequenced by various sequencing technologies, such as whole-genome and targeted Illumina sequencing, barcoded 10x Genomics, and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi.

The ansiform Crus I region contained blink-related Purkinje cells that exhibited a complex spike 20.4 msec after a corneal stimulus and a burst of simple spike activity correlated with the termination of orbicularis oculi activity. This occurrence of the complex spike correlated with trigeminal sensory information associated with the blink-evoking stimulus, and the burst of simple spike activity correlated with sensory feedback about the occurrence of a blink. Inactivation of the inferior olive with lidocaine prevented all complex and significantly reduced simple spike modulation of blink-related Purkinje cells, but did not alter orbicularis oculi activity evoked by corneal stimulation. In contrast, both acute and chronic lesions of the cerebellar cortex containing blink-related Purkinje cells blocked adaptive increases in orbicularis oculi activity of the lid ipsilateral but not contralateral to the lesion. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum is part of a trigeminal reflex blink circuit. Changes in trigeminal signals produce modifications of the cerebellar cortex, which in turn, reinforce or stabilize modifications of brainstem blink circuits. When the trigeminal system does not attempt to alter the magnitude of trigeminal reflex blinks, cerebellar input has little or no effect on reflex blinks."

Here we show that this induction of AP-2 mRNA is at the level of transcription and is transient, reaching a peak 48-72 hr after the addition of RA and declining thereafter, even in the continuous presence of RA. Increased levels of AP-2 mRNA are reflected in a similar elevation of AP-2 protein and accompanied by an increase in the AP-2-binding site-dependent transcriptional activity of a reporter gene. AP-2 also has been proposed to confer TPA and cAMP inducibility on promoters/enhancers containing AP-2-binding sites. We investigated the effect of these agents on the expression of AP-2 protein and mRNA. Our experiments demonstrate that expression of the AP-2 gene in HeLa cells is not elevated significantly by TPA or by a calcium ionophore and is not enhanced at all by agents that increase intracellular cAMP concentration. In fact, AP-2 mRNA is repressed by both TPA and the calcium ionophore A23187 through a delayed response. These data suggest that the AP-2-binding site-mediated cAMP and TPA responses are not regulated at the level of AP-2 expression but, rather, achieved either by post-translational changes in AP-2 or in conjunction with another protein."

E. scolopes is studied in three principal contexts: (1) as a model of cephalopod development; (2) as a model of animal-bacterial symbioses; and (3) as a system for studying adaptations of tissues that interact with light. E. scolopes embryos can be obtained continually and can be reared in the laboratory over an entire generation. The embryos and protective chorions are optically clear, facilitating in situ developmental observations, and can be manipulated experimentally. Many molecular protocols have been developed for studying E. scolopes development. This species is best known, however, for its symbiosis with the luminous marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri and has been used to study determinants of symbiont specificity, the influence of symbiosis on development of the squid light organ, and the mechanisms by which a stable association is achieved. Both partners can be grown independently under laboratory conditions, a feature that offers the unusual opportunity to manipulate the symbiosis experimentally. Molecular and genetic tools have been developed for V. fischeri , and a large expressed sequence tag (EST) database is available for the host symbiotic tissues. Additionally, comparisons between light organ form and function to those of the eye can be made. Both types of tissue interact with light, but have divergent embryonic development. As such, they offer an opportunity to study the molecular basis for the evolution of morphological novelties."
Temporally graded retrograde amnesia following separate and combined lesions of the perirhinal cortex and fornix in the rat.,Learning & Memory,Learn.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained on a series of five visual discrimination problems at distinct time intervals prior to receiving bilateral, electrolytic lesions of the perirhinal cortex or the fornix, combined lesions of both these structures, or sham operations. Following recovery from surgery, rats were retested on the preoperatively learned discrimination problems, as well as learning a new discrimination and discrimination reversal. Results indicated that all animals with lesions exhibited temporally graded retrograde amnesia, whereby memories acquired in the recent past (1-3 weeks) were impaired, and memories acquired in the remote past (6-8 weeks) were spared. There was no difference in the magnitude of retrograde amnesia between the three lesion groups. Animals in the perirhinal, fornix, and combined lesion groups were able to learn a new discrimination problem at a rate comparable to control rats; however, the animals with lesions were impaired at learning the discrimination reversal. The perirhinal, fornix, and combined lesion animals also exhibited a significantly faster forgetting rate over a 2-week retention interval than control rats. These results suggest that medial temporal structures including the perirhinal cortex and the fornix are involved in the consolidation of mnemonic information and that their involvement in this process occurs over a discrete period of time."
Long-range RNA interactions between structural domains of the aphthovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES).,RNA,RNA,1355-8382,1469-9001,,http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/5/10/1374,5,10,10/01/1999,1374,1383,"['R Ramos', 'E Martínez-Salas']","['Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas-Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Cantoblanco, Spain.']","Internal initiation of translation is promoted by internal ribosome entry site (IRES) cis-acting elements. Using transcripts that correspond to the structural domains of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) IRES, we have identified RNA-RNA interactions between separated domains (1-2, 3, 4-5, or HH) of the IRES structure. All the assayed domains were able to interact with the full-length IRES as well as with domain 3, although to a different extent, with the most efficient interactions being those occurring between domains 3 and 4-5, and domains 3 and 1-2. RNA-RNA complexes were stable over 1 h of incubation at 37 degrees C, and depended on Mg2+ and RNA concentration. Neither the antisense domain 1-2 nor tRNA interacted with domain 3, providing experimental evidence of the specificity for the sense strand of the IRES sequence. Additionally, domain 1-2 did not interact with 4-5, leading to the suggestion that domain 3 acts as a scaffold structure where the other domains bind. The thermal disassociation profile of these complexes indicated different strength in these interactions. Whereas 50% of the complexes between domains 3 and 4-5 were destabilized at 45 degrees C, those formed by domain 1-2 and 3 required temperatures higher than 51 degrees C. Efficient self-dimerization of domains 3 and 4-5 was found in the absence of other transcripts. Formation of domain 3 homodimer competed with formation of heterocomplexes with other domains, and conversely, domain 3 homodimers were competed out by the presence of the other domains. RNA interactions were also observed at physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and K1+. The identification of the RNA-RNA complexes reported here provide direct experimental evidence of tertiary interactions within IRES elements."

Overcoming some of these obstacles has paved the way for greater insight into the genomics of PCA. The advent of high-throughput technologies coming from the initial use of microsatellite and oligonucleotide probes gave rise to techniques like comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). With the introduction of massively parallel genomic sequencing, referred to as next-generation sequencing (NGS), a deeper understanding of cancer genomics in general has occurred. Along with these technologic advances, there has been the development of computational biology and statistical approaches to address novel large data sets characterized by single base resolution. This review will provide a historic perspective of PCA genomics with an emphasis on the cardinal mutations and alterations observed to be consistently seen in PCA for both hormone-naïve localized PCA and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). There will be a focus on alterations that have the greatest potential to play a role in disease progression and therapy management."

We evaluated two siblings with TAR-like dysmorphology but lacking thrombocytopenia in infancy. Family NCI-107 participated in an IRB-approved cohort study and underwent comprehensive clinical and genomic evaluations, including aCGH, whole-exome, whole-genome, and targeted sequencing. Gene expression assays and electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed to evaluate the variant of interest. The previously identified TAR-associated 1q21.1 deletion was present in the affected siblings and one healthy parent. Multiple sequencing approaches did not identify previously described TAR-associated SNPs or mutations in relevant genes. We discovered rs61746197 A > G heterozygosity in the parent without the deletion and apparent hemizygosity in both siblings. rs61746197 A > G overlaps a RelA–p65 binding motif, and EMSAs indicate the A allele has higher transcription factor binding efficiency than the G allele. Stimulation of K562 cells to induce megakaryocyte differentiation abrogated the shift of both reference and alternative probes. The 1q21.1 TAR-associated deletion in combination with the G variant of rs61746197 on the nondeleted allele is associated with a TAR-like phenotype. rs61746197 G could be a functional enhancer/repressor element, but more studies are required to identify the specific factor(s) responsible. Overall, our findings suggest a role of rs61746197 A > G and human disease in the setting of a 1q21.1 deletion on the other chromosome."

For example, the amnesic patient H.M., who underwent bilateral medial temporal-lobe resection, shows intact priming with novel patterns, suggesting that perceptual priming with nonverbal material does not depend on areas critical for explicit memory. A logical candidate for the neural substrate that supports this kind of priming is the peristriate cortex, an area that is relatively spared in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We therefore predicted that AD subjects would be unimpaired on pattern priming. Subjects copied each of six target figures onto dot patterns. After performing a 3-min distractor task, they were given the same dot patterns (without lines) and asked to draw the first figure that came to mind by connecting the dots with straight lines. Subsequently, in a test of recognition (explicit) memory, subjects viewed each of the six patterns of dots that they had copied previously and were asked to indicate which of four possible completions corresponded to the figure that they had copied 3 min earlier. The AD and control groups achieved comparable priming scores, but AD subjects were significantly impaired in recognizing the patterns explicitly. Our finding of intact pattern priming in AD provides, for the first time, evidence that pattern priming depends on the peristriate cortex."

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with ALK gene rearrangements or the resulting fusion proteins have been, for the most part, successfully targeted with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The most frequent rearrangement, the EML4-ALK oncogenic fusion, has more than 10 distinct variants, each with a discrete breakpoint in EML4 . Recent studies have suggested that EML4-ALK variants may have differential responses to TKIs. Additionally, non-EML4-ALK fusions that result from ALK rearrangements with diverse 5′ partners could possibly have varied biologic and clinical implications in their therapeutic responses and outcomes of patients with NSCLC. Existing literature documents at least 20 non-EML4 fusion partners for ALK, and the clinical responsiveness to crizotinib ranges from increased sensitivity to resistance. This underscores the importance of identifying the precise 5′ fusion partner to ALK before initiation of therapy. Herein we report the identification of a novel SLMAP-ALK fusion in a patient with NSCLC."

Membrane potential changes in hair cells cause neurotransmitter release from hair cells that initiate electrical signals in the nerve terminals of afferent fibers from spiral ganglion neurons. These signals are then propagated within the central nervous system (CNS) to mediate the sensation of hearing. Recent studies show that the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) machinery of hair cells is formed by an ensemble of proteins. Candidate components forming the MET channel have been identified, but none alone fulfills all criteria necessary to define them as pore-forming subunits of the MET channel. We will review here recent findings on the identification and function of proteins that are components of the MET machinery in hair cells and consider remaining open questions."

We report for the first time temporal changes in the tumor genome assessed in sequential tumor samples of a 48-yr-old patient with a KRAS -mutated LGSOC treated with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib. After an initial long-lasting partial response, rapidly progressive brain metastasis occurred, ultimately leading to patient death. Our study demonstrates that novel genomic alterations accumulated during the course of treatment as a result of therapeutic pressures led to MEK inhibitor resistance and, ultimately, disease evolution with an aggressive behavior observed in this patient. In particular, we describe the presence of ERBB3 amplification and aberrant ERBB3–MYC signaling as a potential mechanism of acquired MEK inhibitor resistance in a patient with LGSOC, which is similar to previous observations in KRAS -mutated colon and lung cancers. Our study highlights the need for an individualized approach to better understand tumor genome evolution and suggests that LGSOC patients may derive improved therapeutic benefit by using a combinatorial strategy used in other cancers in order to overcome emergent resistance to targeted therapies."

Patients with inherited autosomal-dominant CCMs carry loss-of-function mutations in one of three genes: CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3. It is not known why CCM lesions are confined to brain vasculature despite the ubiquitous expression of CCM proteins in all tissues, and whether cell types other than endothelial cells (ECs) contribute to CCM lesion formation. The prevailing view is that the primary defects in CCMs in humans are EC-intrinsic, such that EC-specific deletion of any one of the three genes in mice results in similar CCM lesions. An unexpected finding is that Ccm3 deletion in pericytes (PCs) also induces CCM lesions. CCM3 deletion in ECs or PCs destabilizes PC–EC associations, highlighting the importance of these interactions in CCM formation."

Unexpectedly, the low-grade astrocytoma showed rapid progression within a short time, but subsequent resection showed similar histologic findings to the original biopsy with only slightly more mitoses and a marginally increased Ki-67 proliferative index. Molecular testing performed on the tumor showed no alterations in the IDH1 , IDH2 , EGFR , or BRAF genes by sequencing, intact 1p/19q by FISH, and a novel BCR-NTRK2 fusion transcript by reverse transcription and anchored multiplex PCR. The patient underwent standard-of-care therapy, both first and second line, for a high-grade glioma because of the aggressive behavior, but the glioma continued to progress despite treatment, and the patient died within 13.5 mo of the original diagnosis. At the time of diagnosis, the BCR-NTRK2 fusion transcript had not been described in solid tumors; however, a recent publication described this fusion transcript in two glioblastomas. Although no approved therapy was available for this patient, FDA approval has now been given for solid tumors with any NTRK gene family fusions. This unexpected molecular finding in a deceptively low-grade-appearing glioma supports the use of expanded molecular testing in gliomas and solid tumors, particularly in instances where targeted therapies are available."

After incomplete surgical resection, molecular analysis of the tumor identified unusually high numbers of mutations and intratumor heterogeneity by a hotspot next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. Further comprehensive molecular profiling identified a TMB of 343 mutations/Mb. An ultra-hypermutation genotype in pediatric GBMs is suggestive of a constitutive mismatch repair deficiency syndrome (CMMRD), which often acquires additional somatic driver mutations in replicating DNA polymerase genes. Tumor sequencing identified two MSH6 nonsense variants, a hotspot POLE mutation and a mutational signature supportive of a germline MMR deficiency with a somatic POLE mutation. However, constitutional testing identified only one nonsense MSH6 variant consistent with a Lynch syndrome diagnosis. This case represents the first confirmed Lynch syndrome case mimicking CMMRD by manifesting as an ultra-hypermutated pediatric GBM, following somatic mutations in MSH6 and POLE . These findings permitted the patient's enrollment in an anti-PD-1 clinical trial for children with ultra-hypermutated GBM.

However, calcification is commonly found in soft tissues in association with aging and in a variety of diseases. Over the last two decades, it has emerged that calcification occurring in diseased arteries is not simply an inevitable build-up of insoluble precipitates of calcium phosphate. In some cases, it is an active process in which transcription factors drive conversion of vascular cells to an osteoblast or chondrocyte-like phenotype, with the subsequent production of mineralizing “matrix vesicles.” Early studies of bone and cartilage calcification suggested roles for cellular calcium signaling in several of the processes involved in the regulation of bone calcification. Similarly, calcium signaling has recently been highlighted as an important component in the mechanisms regulating pathological calcification. The emerging hypothesis is that ectopic/pathological calcification occurs in tissues in which there is an imbalance in the regulatory mechanisms that actively prevent calcification. This review highlights the various ways that calcium signaling regulates tissue calcification, with a particular focus on pathological vascular calcification."

Here, we examined this effect in amnesia. Amnesic patients and controls viewed a slide presentation while listening to an accompanying emotionally arousing story. In both groups, recognition memory was enhanced for the emotionally arousing story elements. The magnitude of the enhancement was proportional for both amnesic patients and controls. Emotional reactions to the story were also equivalent. The results suggest that the enhancement of declarative memory associated with emotional arousal is intact in amnesia. Together with findings from patients with bilateral amygdala lesions, the results indicate that the amygdala is responsible for the enhancement effect."

At the 3' end these sequences extend over more than 150 bp and include 11- and 31-bp sequences found repeated in inverted orientation at the 5' end. The P element's 5' end, however, cannot function as its 3' end. When two 3' P-element ends are present, the more proximal end is used preferentially. We found also that the duplication of the target site does not appear to play a role in forward transposition."
A novel 5 displacement spin-labeling technique for electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of RNA.,RNA,RNA,1355-8382,1469-9001,,http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/5/9/1158,5,9,09/01/1999,1158,1166,"['J C Macosko', 'M S Pio', 'I Tinoco', 'Y K Shin']","['Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 94720-1460, USA.']","An RNA spin-labeling technique was developed using the well-characterized interaction between the HIV Rev peptide and the Rev response element (RRE) RNA as a model system. Spin-labeled RNA molecules were prepared by incorporating guanosine monophosphorothioate (GMPS) at the 5' end using T7 RNA polymerase and then covalently attaching a thiol-specific nitroxide spin label. Three different constructs of the RRE RNA were made by strategically displacing the 5' end within the native three-dimensional structure. Nitroxide-to-nitroxide distance measurements were made between the specifically bound RNA and peptide using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The dipolar EPR method can reliably measure distances up to 25 A, the calculation of which is derived from the 1/r3 dependence of the broadening of EPR lines in motionally frozen samples. This RNA-labeling technique, dubbed 5' displacement spin labeling, extends the usefulness of the dipolar EPR method developed for analysis of protein structure. The advantage of this technique is that it is applicable to large RNA systems such as the ribosome, which are difficult to study by other structural methods."

Oct-2, a B-cell-specific transcription factor, binds tightly to the octamer sequence in immunoglobulin promoters. A second apparently unrelated consensus sequence in heavy chain promoters, the heptamer site, also is recognized by the Oct-2 protein but with 1000-fold lower affinity. Simultaneous occupancy of both the octamer and heptamer sites is favored by cooperative interactions. The heptamer site is probably recognized by the same binding surface in the Oct-2 protein as the octamer site and thus is conserved as a lower-affinity binding site. This permits the immunoglobulin promoter to respond to a much broader range of levels of Oct-2 protein. Substitution of prototype octamer sequences for heptamer sequences yields a probe with two octamer sites spaced by 2 nucleotides, which also binds Oct-2 protein cooperatively. Only the POU domain in the Oct-2 protein is required for this cooperative interaction. Similar protein-protein interactions between bound Oct-2 proteins may promote promoter-enhancer synergism in the heavy chain gene."

Intraoral infusions of sucrose induce c-Fos-like immunoreactivity (c-FLI) in the intermediate nucleus of the solitary tract (iNTS) after a CTA has been acquired for sucrose. Sucrose infusions do not induce c-FLI in the iNTS of unconditioned rats or in conditioned rats after extinction of the CTA. Here, we describe persistence of altered responsiveness of the iNTS in rats with CTAs against sucrose by intraorally infusing sucrose 2 days, 3 months, or 6 months after acquisition of the CTA. Sucrose infusions induced c-FLI in the iNTS 6 months after conditioning. The behavioral expression of the CTA was attenuated at 6 months but not at 3 months; the number of c-FLI positive cells in the iNTS was proportional to the magnitude of the expression of the CTA. This evidence strengthens our hypothesis that c-FLI in the iNTS is a neuronal correlate of the expression of a CTA."

This is driven by the expanding category of targeted therapies that require a broader understanding of the mutational profile of patient samples to more precisely guided personalized treatment decisions. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has proved to be of tremendous power in detecting and characterizing a broad spectrum of activating or loss-of-function mutations across many gene targets. This power of NGS also results in significant challenges related to technical expertise, bioinformatics, computing infrastructure, laboratory practices, and integration into clinical decision-making. These challenges are particularly relevant to smaller and mid-tier hospital networks that are faced with the need to modernize their clinical practices and offer their patients access to advanced genomic technologies to improve outcomes. Adoption of such personalized medicine relies on information about a patient's cancer genome and the identification of its variants. This is best achieved using NGS. However, there are challenges to the adoption of such a complex technology and workflow, especially in smaller hospital systems. This commentary summarizes key considerations and challenges related to implementation of NGS in a community hospital setting."
Sensorimotor skill learning in amnesia: additional evidence for the neural basis of nondeclarative memory.,Learning & Memory,Learn.

All 28 amnesics had normal learning of a rotor pursuit task. We also studied in detail the sensorimotor skill learning of patient Boswell. As a result of bilateral damage to both mesial and lateral aspects of the temporal lobes and to the basal forebrain, Boswell has one of the most severe impairments ever reported for learning of all types of declarative knowledge. Compared to matched controls, Boswell acquired and retained normally the skills associated with performing motor tasks. We conducted a long-term (2-year) followup study of Boswell's retention of the rotor pursuit task, and we found that he retained the skill as well as normal controls. Our study builds on previous work in the following respects: (1) It provides evidence, for the first time, that skill learning is normal in basal forebrain amnesics; (2) it shows that patient Boswell has normal learning and long-term retention of sensorimotor skills, in spite of his extensive damage; and (3) it offers additional evidence that mesial temporal lobe damage spares skill learning. These findings demonstrate unequivocally that sensorimotor skill learning does not require structures in mesial and lateral temporal regions nor in basal forebrain."

Twenty-one BACs were isolated from an amplisome-enriched library by colony hybridization. The insert sizes range from 25 to 143 kb, with an average size of 82 kb. The coverage of the amplisome in clones is approximately 2.7-fold. To construct a physical map of the amplisome, we used three different but complementary methods: hybridization, STS content mapping, and fingerprinting. In addition, we compared the advantages and the drawbacks of these techniques in mapping the amplisomal BACs. The 21 BACs were grouped into two contigs and the two small gaps (3.5 and 26.5 kb) were filled by screening of a human genomic BAC library. The organization of the amplisome revealed by the BAC-based physical map is consistent with the long-range restriction map reported previously. Our results demonstrate that a 630-kb region can be rapidly cloned and mapped into contigs by use of the BAC system. Because of the low frequency (<0.1%) of chimerism and rearrangement, these BAC clones are ready for DNA sequencing and functional analysis."

There were significant geographic differences in the distribution of the haplotypes, several of which were seen in only one population and can be used as populational markers in future surveys. The haplotypic diversity in major ethnic groups revealed high levels in Greater Asians, followed by Africans and Caucasians, and a very low diversity was seen in Amerindians. The discrimination probability of such haplotypes for a random sample of Brazilian Caucasians was 0.82, suggesting great potential usefulness in forensic studies. The parsimonious relationship between different alpha(h) types and the addition of the YAP polymorphism data allowed the construction of an informative picture of the origin and evolution of the antiquity of the alpha(h) polymorphism. The DYS19 allele diversity related to each alpha(h) type allowed a crude estimation of the antiquity of many alpha(h) types. These ancient alpha(h) types were present in different populations suggesting a common ancestor that could antedate the first out-of-Africa migrations."

This activity stimulates transcription of coinjected rRNA templates in Xenopus oocytes and has been named TFIS, as it binds to the enhancer sequences within the intergenic spacer. In addition to its enhancer binding activity, TFIS binds to the promoter of the Xenopus rRNA genes, as predicted by models for enhancer action. DNase I footprinting on promoter mutants suggests that there are three TFIS-binding sites between -70 and -240 and that TFIS binding is unusually tolerant of mutations. The large region of protein-DNA interaction and the occurrence of DNase I enhancements at integral multiples of the helical repeat are consistent with the promoter and enhancer DNA wrapping around TFIS."

The rat prolactin and growth hormone genes are expressed selectively in distinct cell types (lactotrophs and somatotrophs, respectively) of the anterior pituitary gland, reflecting differential mechanisms of gene activation or restriction, as a result of the interactions of multiple factors binding to these genes. We find that when the pituitary-specific 33-kD transcription factor Pit-1, expressed normally in both lactotrophs and somatotrophs, is expressed in either the heterologous HeLa cell line or in bacteria, it binds to and activates transcription from both growth hormone and prolactin promoters in vitro at levels even 10-fold lower than those normally present in pituitary cells. This suggests that a single factor, Pit-1, may be capable of activating the expression of two genes that define different anterior pituitary cell phenotypes. Because a putative lactotroph cell line (235-1) that does not express the growth hormone gene, but only the prolactin gene, appears to contain high levels of functional Pit-1, a mechanism selectively preventing growth hormone gene expression may, in part, account for the lactotroph phenotype."

This effect on blood vessels could explain the amnestic effects produced by nonspecific NOS inhibitors. The results support the theory that NO is a neuronal transmitter that is important in processes of synaptic plasticity and learning."

Thum']","['Leipzig University, Institute for Biology, 04103 Leipzig, Germany']","The Drosophila larva has become an attractive model system for studying fundamental questions in neuroscience. Although the focus was initially on topics such as the structure of genes, mechanisms of inheritance, genetic regulation of development, and the function and physiology of ion channels, today it is often on the cellular and molecular principles of naive and learned behavior. Drosophila larvae have developed different mechanisms, often widespread in similar manifestations in the animal kingdom, to orient themselves toward olfactory, gustatory, mechanosensory, thermal, and visual stimuli to coordinate their locomotion appropriately. To adapt to changes in the environment, larvae are able to learn to categorize some of these sensory impressions as “good” or “bad.” Depending on their relevance and reliability, the larva learns them and constantly updates these memories. Laboratory experiments allow us to parametrically study and describe many of these processes (e.g., olfactory appetitive and aversive memory or visual appetitive and aversive memory). Combining behavioral tests with various neurogenetic techniques allows us to thermally or optogenetically activate or inhibit individual cells during learning, memory consolidation, and memory retrieval. The molecular and genetic bases of larval learning can be analyzed by using specific mutants. The CRISPR–Cas method has established extensive new directions in this area, in addition to the already wide-ranging traditional approaches, like the GAL4 / UAS system. The combination of these genetic methods with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of the introduced behavioral assay provides a platform for discovering the fundamental mechanisms underlying learning and memory formation in the rather simple larval brain."

Renfree']","['Department of Zoology, The University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia']","This protocol describes methods for collecting and handling tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) conceptuses. Zygotes, cleavage stages, diapausing blastocysts, and unexpanded blastocysts are ~250 μm in diameter and are collected by flushing either the oviduct or uterus. Later stages are collected by opening the uterus. Late preimplantation stages must be handled carefully because their large size (>2 cm in diameter) results in high surface tension within the yolk sac, especially on the delicate avascular area. When handled too roughly, the embryonic vesicle tends to split and then rapidly collapse; such embryos do not reinflate. If embryos are to be cultured, all steps during collection must be carried out aseptically. In all cases, solutions should be prewarmed to 37°C and embryos should be kept warm by use of a heating stage. Standard fixatives, fixation times, and washing protocols used for mouse embryos are also used for tammar embryos. Methods for embedding tammar conceptuses in paraffin wax depend on the size and stage of the conceptus."
Characterization of RNA-based and protein-only RNases P from bacteria encoding both enzyme types,RNA,RNA,1355-8382,1469-9001,10.1261/rna.079459.122,http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/29/3/376,29,3,03/01/2023,376,391,"['Markus Gößringer', 'Nadine B.

We characterized the dual RNase P activities of five bacteria that belong to three different phyla. All five bacterial species encode functional RNA (gene rnpB ) and protein (gene rnpA ) subunits of RNP RNase P, but only the HARP of the thermophile Thermodesulfatator indicus (phylum Thermodesulfobacteria) was found to have robust tRNA 5′-end maturation activity in vitro and in vivo in an Escherichia coli RNase P depletion strain. These findings suggest that both types of RNase P are able to contribute to the essential tRNA 5′-end maturation activity in T. indicus , thus resembling the predicted evolutionary transition state in the progenitor of the Aquificaceae before the loss of rnpA and rnpB genes in this family of bacteria. Remarkably, T. indicus RNase P RNA is transcribed with a P12 expansion segment that is posttranscriptionally excised in vivo, such that the major fraction of the RNA is fragmented and thereby truncated by ∼70 nt in the native T. indicus host as well as in the E. coli complementation strain. Replacing the native P12 element of T. indicus RNase P RNA with the short P12 helix of Thermotoga maritima RNase P RNA abolished fragmentation, but simultaneously impaired complementation efficiency in E. coli cells, suggesting that intracellular fragmentation and truncation of T. indicus RNase P RNA may be beneficial to RNA folding and/or enzymatic activity."

We have used site-specific mutagenesis to examine the contribution of individual leucine residues to the formation of a stable Fos-Jun protein complex and the binding of this complex to the AP-1 site. Mutation of a single leucine in either Fos or Jun had no effect on protein complex formation. Furthermore, mutations of two consecutive leucines in Jun did not interfere with heterodimer formation; however, in the case of Fos, two consecutive mutations resulted in an inability to form a heterodimer. Although mutagenesis of the first leucine of the heptad repeat had no effect on protein complex formation, this mutation in either Fos or Jun drastically reduced the affinity of the complex for DNA. Thus, both Fos and Jun contribute directly to the DNA-binding potential of the heterodimer."

Analysis of the 5' end of one of the clones (8-1), which was originally thought to represent the 5' end of LIS1, indicates a striking similarity to mouse 14-3-3 epsilon. We have isolated a full-length cDNA of human 14-3-3 epsilon, for which sequence analysis reveals a strong nucleotide conservation with mouse 14-3-3 epsilon in both translated and untranslated regions (UTRs). Additionally, the predicted peptides of human, sheep, rat, and mouse 14-3-3 epsilon are identical. Using a 205-bp fragment common to LIS1 (8-1) and 14-3-3 epsilon as probe on adult and fetal multiple-tissue Northern blots, a -2-kb transcript is detected, identical to the pattern observed with a full-length 14-3-3 epsilon cDNA probe. LIS1-specific transcripts of approximately 7.5 and approximately 5 kb are not detected by the 0.2-kb probe, indicating that the similarity between the 5' sequence of LIS1 (8-1) and the 3' UTR of 14-3-3 epsilon is not the result of shared homology between the two genes. Instead, clone 8-1 is a chimera of 14-3-3 epsilon and LIS1 partial cDNAs, and therefore its 5' sequence does not represent the LIS1 5' end. Interestingly, we have mapped the 14-3-3 epsilon gene to the same chromosomal sub-band as LIS1 (17p13.3). However, 14-3-3 epsilon lies telomeric to LIS1 and outside the Miller-Dieker syndrome chromosome region but in a region frequently deleted in several types of cancer, and is a reasonable candidate tumor suppressor gene."

We find that deletion of Malat1 leads to inhibition of proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Interestingly, this coincides with an increase in the expression of miR-26 family members miR-26a and miR-26b in differentiating ESCs. Inactivation of miR-26a/b rescues the proliferative phenotype of Malat1 knockout (KO) cells and leads to accelerated neuronal differentiation of compound Malat1KO/mir-26KO ESCs.

Polyoma virus (PyV) enhancers had no effect on the level of gene expression or competition for transcription factors as long as the DNA remained either in the oocyte germinal vesicle or the pronuclei of one-cell embryos. Expression of injected genes could be observed in pronuclei because the signal that normally triggers zygotic gene expression in two-cell embryos still occurred in one-cell embryos arrested in S phase. However, when the tk promoter was injected into zygotic nuclei of two-cell embryos, enhancers increased the number of embryos that expressed luciferase as well as the level of luciferase activity per embryo. PyV enhancer mutation F101, selected for growth in mouse embryonal carcinoma F9 cells, stimulated expression in developing two-cell embryos about seven times better than the wild-type PyV enhancer and competed effectively for factors required for transcription. These results were consistent with the fact that enhancers are required to activate the PyV origin of DNA replication in developing two-cell embryos but not in one-cell embryos. The maximum levels of gene expression in oocytes, one-cell embryos, and developing two-cell embryos (1:67:21) were inversely related to the extent of chromatin assembly, but the need for enhancers was independent of chromatin assembly. Therefore, it appears that the need for enhancers to activate promoters or origins of replication results from some negative regulatory factor that first appears as a component of zygotic nuclear structure."

A comparison with the unliganded structure has revealed global changes in the RNA structure in the presence of metal ions, whereas thermodynamic measurements have shown increased stability. Moreover, in the structure with Ba 2+ , an unusual noncanonical G( syn )-G( syn ) pair is observed instead of the common G( anti )-G( syn ).

A commonly employed biochemical technique to identify metal-binding sites in RNA is the rescue of Rp alpha-phosphorothioate (PS) interference by the addition of soft divalent metal ions. To access the ability of such experiments to accurately identify metal-ion coordinations within a complex RNA fold, we report metal-rescue results from the Tetrahymena group I intron P4-P6 domain, where the location and coordination of five divalent metal ions have been determined by X-ray crystallography [J.H. Cate et al., Nat Struct Biol, 1997, 4:553]. We used a native gel mobility-shift to assay for P4-P6 folding in the presence of various divalent metal ions, and found that even moderate concentrations of Mn2+ (> or =0.5 mM) can rescue PS interference at sites that do not coordinate metal ions within the P4-P6 crystal structure. To control for such effects, 2'-deoxynucleotide interference was used to titrate the Mn2+ concentration to a level that produces metal-ion-specific rescue (0.3 mM). This concentration of Mn2+ specifically rescued four of the six metal-dependent phosphorothioate effects within the RNA domain, including PS interference resulting from outer-sphere coordination to the metals. Both sites that were not specifically rescued make inner-sphere metal-ion coordinations. Cd2+ and Zn2+ afforded rescue at a smaller subset of the six metal-specific PS sites, though again phosphates making outer-sphere coordinations to metal ions were rescued preferentially. These data on P4-P6 domain folding reinforce the need for caution when interpreting metal-rescue experiments."

Here we focus on two highly conserved systems that underlie many of the key symmetry-breaking events that occur during embryonic and larval development in the worm. One involves the interplay between Par proteins, Rho GTPases, and the actomyosin cytoskeleton and mediates asymmetric cell divisions that establish the germline. The other uses elements of the Wnt signaling pathway and a highly reiterative mechanism that distinguishes anterior from posterior daughter cell fates. Much of what we know about these systems comes from intensive study of a few key events—Par/Rho/actomyosin-mediated polarization of the zygote in response to a sperm-derived cue and the Wnt-mediated induction of endoderm at the four-cell stage. However, a growing body of work is revealing how C. elegans exploits elements/variants of these systems to accomplish a diversity of symmetry-breaking tasks throughout embryonic and larval development."

The NEI-VFQ was one of the earliest PROMs developed using concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing of patients, but it lacks items that are common to patients with IRDs and it has poor measurement properties. Recent advances in PROM development include the Michigan Retinal Degeneration Questionnaire (MRDQ) and the ViSIO-PRO for nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP), both of which have been qualitatively and quantitatively validated. As these new tools are used in clinical studies, they will generate additional evidence about their measurement characteristics.

Previous studies showed that UPF1 has a low basal catalytic activity that is greatly enhanced upon binding of its interaction partner, UPF2. Activation of UPF1 by UPF2 entails a large conformational change that switches the helicase from an RNA-clamping mode to an RNA-unwinding mode. The ability of UPF1 to bind RNA was expected to be unaffected by this activation mechanism. Here we show, using a combination of biochemical and biophysical methods, that binding of UPF2 to UPF1 drastically reduces the affinity of UPF1 for RNA, leading to a release of the bound RNA. Although UPF2 is capable of binding RNA in vitro, our results suggest that dissociation of the UPF1–RNA complex is not a consequence of direct competition in RNA binding but rather an allosteric effect that is likely mediated by the conformational change in UPF1 that is induced upon binding its activator. We discuss these results in light of transient interactions forged during mRNP assembly, particularly in the UPF1-dependent mRNA decay pathways."

The oomycete pathogen Peronospora parasitica has been used by several groups and is described in this protocol. Working with Peronospora is complicated by the fact that it is an obligate biotroph, and consequently cultures must be maintained on living plants. There is no central repository for Peronospora stocks, but most investigators who work with them are willing to provide samples of infected tissue. These can be used to initiate new stock cultures, or they can be maintained as live cultures on seedlings. One of the most important factors in maintaining Peronospora is the humidity of the growth chamber, which must be kept at a minimum of 80%. Various Peronospora isolates are available. These vary with respect to which Arabidopsis ecotypes they can infect, because some combinations trigger gene-for-gene resistance. Thus, it is important that the appropriate ecotype is inoculated with the appropriate strain of pathogen. The extent of infections can be rated or quantitatively measured as the number of spores produced per plant, and frozen tissue stocks can be prepared from heavily infected tissue."

Most remaining unique features, such as loss of the lagenar macula, coiling of the cochlea, and bony laminae supporting the basilar membrane, arose later, after the separation of the monotreme lineage, but before marsupial and placental mammals diverged. The question of when hearing sensitivity first extended into the ultrasonic range (defined here as >20 kHz) remains speculative, not least because of the late appearance of the definitive mammalian middle ear. The last significant change was optimizing the operating voltage range of prestin, and thus the efficiency of the outer hair cells’ amplifying action, in the placental lineage only."

Cholesterol transport from the PM to low-sterol regulatory regions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) controls cholesterol synthesis and uptake, and thereby influences the rates of cholesterol flux between tissues of complex organisms. Cholesterol transfer to the ER is also required for steroidogenesis, oxysterol and bile acid synthesis, and cholesterol esterification. The ER-resident Aster proteins (Aster-A, -B, and -C) form contacts with the PM to move cholesterol to the ER in mammals. Mice lacking Aster-B have low adrenal cholesteryl ester stores and impaired steroidogenesis because of a defect in cholesterol transport from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to the ER. This work reviews the molecular characteristics of Asters, their role in HDL- and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol movement, and how cholesterol transferred to the ER is utilized by cells. The roles of other lipid transporters and of membrane lipid organization in maintaining aspects of cholesterol homeostasis are also highlighted."

We identified novel compound heterozygous variants in SLC6A5 (NM_004211.4:c.[1429T > C];[1430delC]) by trio whole-exome sequencing, containing a base deletion inherited by the asymptomatic mother leading to a frameshift (c.1430delC, p.Ser477PhefsTer9) and a de novo base exchange leading to an amino acid change (c.1429T > C, p.Ser477Pro). To date, there are four known disease-associated genes for primary hyperekplexia, all of which are involved in the functioning of glycinergic synapses. SLC6A5 encodes the sodium- and chloride-dependent glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2), which recaptures glycine, a major inhibitory transmitter in the brainstem and spinal cord. The diagnosis altered the patient's medical care to his benefit because SLC6A5 mutations with rather benign courses of hyperekplexia may be spared of needless pharmacotherapy. Symptoms eventually decreased in frequency until about once in 2 mo at 2 yr age. We present the first report of halting hyperekplexia episodes by maternal soothing in multiple instances. We highlight the importance of clarifying the genetic diagnosis by rapid next-generation sequencing techniques in this group of infantile apneic attacks with hyperekplexia due to the broad differential diagnoses."

We analyze changes in transcriptional patterns of genes, transposable elements (TEs), and piRNAs. We find that testes seem to undergo only marginal changes during aging. In contrast, in middle-aged ovaries, the time point associated with peak female fertility in this strain, PIWI pathway components are transiently down-regulated, TE transcription is elevated, and piRNA levels generally decrease, suggesting that egg quality may already be declining at middle-age. Furthermore, we show that piRNA ping-pong biogenesis declines steadily with age in ovaries, whereas it is maintained in aging testes. To our knowledge, this data set represents the most comprehensive transcriptomic data set for vertebrate gonadal aging. This resource also highlights important pathways that are regulated during reproductive aging in either ovaries or testes, which could ultimately be leveraged to help restore aspects of youthful reproductive function."

The E4F factor has been purified and shown to stimulate transcription in vitro from the E4 promoter. Analysis of the affinity-purified factor identifies a single polypeptide of 50 kD that has E4F-specific binding activity. E4F binding activity is also regulated during F9 cell differentiation and can be activated in differentiated F9 cells by viral infection. Furthermore, the activation process appears to involve a phosphorylation event, because treatment of E4F with alkaline phosphatase abolishes activity and incubation of the phosphatase-inactivated factor with an extract from virus infected cells restores activity."

Interactions between cadherin ectodomains from apposed cells mediate cell–cell contact, whereas the intracellular region functionally links cadherins to the underlying cytoskeleton. Structural, biophysical, and biochemical studies have provided important insights into the mechanism and specificity of cell–cell adhesion by classical cadherins and their interplay with the cytoskeleton. Adhesive binding arises through exchange of β strands between the first extracellular cadherin domains (EC1) of partner cadherins from adjacent cells. This “strand-swap” binding mode is common to classical and desmosomal cadherins, but sequence alignments suggest that other cadherins will bind differently. The intracellular region of classical cadherins binds to p120 and β-catenin, and β-catenin binds to the F-actin binding protein α-catenin. Rather than stably bridging β-catenin to actin, it appears that α-catenin actively regulates the actin cytoskeleton at cadherin-based cell–cell contacts."

In these protein-DNA complexes, the PRTF moiety interacts with a degenerate dyad symmetric sequence, the P box. PRTF contributes also to the regulation of a second set of cell-type-specific genes, the a-specific genes. We used two in vitro assays to show that PRTF is encoded, at least in part, by the MCM1 gene. In one assay, truncated MCM1 proteins encoded by deletion derivatives of the MCM1 gene formed protein-DNA complexes of novel mobility, demonstrated that MCM1 can bind to the P-box-containing DNA. Second, antibodies raised to a synthetic MCM1 polypeptide retard the migration of PRTF-DNA complexes in gel mobility shift assays. This result indicates that PRTF, defined as an activity that binds cooperatively with alpha 1 to alpha-specific UAS elements, shares an epitope with MCM1. In addition, we show that MCM1 deletions that remove the carboxy-terminal 129 codons of 286 total codons encode truncated MCM1 molecules that are competent to activate transcription in vivo, indicating that the carboxy-terminal residues are not required for this process."

The alleles arose by imprecise excision of a transposable element, Tam3, and we show that they carry a series of deletions involving progressive removal of sequences adjacent to the excision site. This has enabled us to define three cis-acting upstream regions, A, B, and C, which differentially affect the level of pallida expression in distinct areas of the flower. We show further that an unlinked locus, delila, regulates the spatial distribution of pallida transcript. Deletion of regions ABC at the pallida locus uncouples pallida from regulation by delila, whereas deletion of A or AB brings pallida under regulation by delila in a new area of the flower. These results suggest that diverse patterns of pallida expression reflect the different ways in which alleles interact with a prepattern of both common and spatially specific genetic signals in the flower."

Conversely, in males, Sxl must remain functionally off through development. Here, we show that the Sxl transcription unit spans a DNA segment of greater than 20 kb and encodes at least 10 distinct, but overlapping, RNA species. These RNAs range in size from 4.4 to 1.7 kb and exhibit sex, stage, and tissue specificity. Six RNAs, three female specific and three male specific, are first detected by midembryogenesis and persist through the adult stage: Their expression reflects the on/off regulation of Sxl's activity at the level of sex-specific alternate splicing. Four Sxl RNAs are found in adult females. Two of these RNAs are dependent on the presence of a functional germ line and may be relevant to Sxl's role in adult germ-line development. All four are present in unfertilized eggs. Finally, three Sxl RNAs are found only transiently during very early embryogenesis; we suggest that the expression of these RNAs may reflect an early regulation of Sxl at the level of transcription and that these transcripts are involved in the initial selection of the Sxl activity state in response to the primary sex-determination signal, the X/A ratio."

However, as sequencing costs reduce, and the tools to effectively analyze complex and large-scale data improve, the ability to effectively characterize whole genomes at scale in a clinically relevant time frame is now being piloted. This ability effectively blurs the line between clinical cancer research and the clinical management of the disease. This leads to a new paradigm in cancer management in which real-time analysis of an individual’s disease can have a rapid and lasting impact on our understanding of how clinical practices need to change to exploit novel therapeutic rationales.

Although many mosquito species are not attracted to humans and do not feed on blood, human-biting female mosquitoes are strongly attracted to people and use chemosensory cues to identify a suitable host for a blood meal. Mosquitoes need blood components to reproduce, rendering them excellent vectors for blood-borne diseases. The three genera ( Culex , Anopheles , and Aedes ) responsible for most of these diseases find hosts by using their peripheral sensory organs. These organs include the antennae, maxillary palps, and proboscis. All three contain diverse populations of highly sensitive neurons that express sensory receptors that can detect odorants, temperature, chemicals, and tastants. Although these organs are essential to the host-seeking behavior that results in biting, their small size and thick outer cuticle can hinder typical histochemical analyses. Here, we briefly review the role the peripheral sensory organs play in mosquito behavior. Then, we introduce how to investigate their gene expression profiles using immunohistochemical and RNA in situ approaches for both whole-mount and frozen-section preparations."

However, it is now well-established that, in addition to GAs, brassinosteroids and strigolactones also control plant height. In this review, we describe the synthesis and signaling pathways of these three hormones as understood in rice and discuss the mutants and transgenics in these pathways that confer semidwarfism and other valuable architectural traits.

Although the functions of p53 gene and its protein as a tumor suppressor have been firmly established, the earliest functions for the p53 ancestral genes in worms and flies are to ensure germ-line genomic integrity and the fidelity of the developmental process. In vertebrates, the p53 family of genes retains those functions in germ-line genomic integrity but have added important functions in regulation of reproduction. Loss of the p53, p63, or p73 genes in female mice leads to a significant decrease of fertility. The p53 gene product regulates maternal reproduction at the implantation stage of the embryo. p63 and p73 play important roles in monitoring the genomic quality of oocytes. The p53 pathway appears to play a similar role in human fertility. In humans, certain alleles containing a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the p53 pathway are under positive evolutionary selection. Selected alleles of these SNPs in the p53 pathway are associated with decreased fertility. This important function of the p53 pathway in reproduction provides a plausible explanation for the evolution of p53 as a tumor suppressor gene and the positive selection of some alleles in the p53 gene and its pathway. These observations provide a good possible example of antagonistic pleiotrophy for fertility, tumor suppression, and longevity."

Size and fiber number of the mushroom bodies, central complex, and optic lobes are influenced by social, spatial, or olfactory cues. Recently, the optic lobes have been shown to depend on the light regime that flies experience. Structural plasticity in the brain is thought to be a correlate of functional adaptations and long-term memory. We therefore extend our investigation of volume changes to the calyces of the mushroom bodies and the central complex. We show that rearing flies in constant light for 4 days increases the volume of both structures by up to 15% compared to rearing them in total darkness. Much of this difference develops during the first day. The effect of light is not hormonally mediated, as monocularly deprived flies develop a smaller ipsilateral calyx. Mutant analysis suggests that light generates its effects through known visual pathways. In contrast to the optic lobes, in the calyx and central complex structural changes can be linked to cAMP signaling, as in the mutants dunce1 and amnesiac1 no volume differences are observed. Surprisingly, the mutant rutabaga1 shows a prominent light-dependent volume increase in the calyx and central complex, dissociating structural from behavioral plasticity. In complete darkness wild-type flies grow larger calyces under crowded conditions in their normal culture vials than if kept in small groups on fresh food. This stimulating effect of crowding is not observed in any of the cAMP mutants, including rutabaga1."

The limiting factor in the enrichment of purified CTC populations is their sparse availability, heterogeneity, and altered phenotypes relative to the primary tumor. Intensive research both at the technical and molecular fronts led to the development of assays that ease CTC detection and identification from peripheral blood. Most CTC detection methods based on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) use a mix of size selection, marker-based white blood cell (WBC) depletion, and antibodies targeting tumor-associated antigens. However, the majority of these methods either miss out on atypical CTCs or suffer from WBC contamination. We present unCTC, an R package for unbiased identification and characterization of CTCs from single-cell transcriptomic data. unCTC features many standard and novel computational and statistical modules for various analyses. These include a novel method of scRNA-seq clustering, named deep dictionary learning using k -means clustering cost (DDLK), expression-based copy number variation (CNV) inference, and combinatorial, marker-based verification of the malignant phenotypes. DDLK enables robust segregation of CTCs and WBCs in the pathway space, as opposed to the gene expression space.

However, many obstacles remain before the clinical use of NGS-based test results, including technical challenges, functional interpretation, and strict requirements for diagnostic tests. Advanced computational analyses, high-throughput screening methodologies, and generation of shared resources with cell-based and clinical information will facilitate the integration of NGS data into candidate genotyping approaches, likely enhancing future drug phenotype predictions in patients."
Active enhancers strengthen insulation by RNA-mediated CTCF binding at chromatin domain boundaries,Genome Research,Genome Res.,1088-9051,1549-5469,10.1101/gr.276643.122,https://genome.cshlp.org/content/33/1/1,33,1,01/01/2023,1,17,"['Zubairul Islam', 'Bharath Saravanan', 'Kaivalya Walavalkar', 'Umer Farooq', 'Anurag Kumar Singh', 'Sabarinathan Radhakrishnan', 'Jitendra Thakur', 'Awadhesh Pandit', 'Steven Henikoff', 'Dimple Notani']","['National Center for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute for Fundamental Research, Bangalore, Karnataka 560065, India', 'Sastra Deemed University, Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu 613401, India', 'The University of Trans-Disciplinary Health Sciences and Technology, Bangalore, Karnataka 560064, India', 'Department of Biology, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA', 'Basic Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA']","Vertebrate genomes are partitioned into chromatin domains or topologically associating domains (TADs), which are typically bound by head-to-head pairs of CTCF binding sites. Transcription at domain boundaries correlates with better insulation; however, it is not known whether the boundary transcripts themselves contribute to boundary function. Here we characterize boundary-associated RNAs genome-wide, focusing on the disease-relevant INK4a/ARF and MYC TAD. Using CTCF site deletions and boundary-associated RNA knockdowns, we observe that boundary-associated RNAs facilitate recruitment and clustering of CTCF at TAD borders. The resulting CTCF enrichment enhances TAD insulation, enhancer–promoter interactions, and TAD gene expression. Importantly, knockdown of boundary-associated RNAs results in loss of boundary insulation function. Using enhancer deletions and CRISPRi of promoters, we show that active TAD enhancers, but not promoters, induce boundary-associated RNA transcription, thus defining a novel class of regulatory enhancer RNAs."
"Overexpression of a calcium-binding protein, S100 beta, in astrocytes alters synaptic plasticity and impairs spatial learning in transgenic mice.",Learning & Memory,Learn.

Altering astrocytic calcium processes in vivo may therefore affect neuronal and behavioral phenotypes. Previously, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress an astrocytic calcium-binding protein, S100 beta. Immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization showed elevated expression in the astrocytes of the hippocampus and other brain regions. Neurons in the hippocampus were negative for S100 beta. In this paper we analyze the hippocampal electrophysiology and learning properties of mice from two transgenic lines. Significant differences were found between the hippocampal slices of normal and transgenic mice in their response to high frequency (100 Hz) stimulation. The overall distribution of post-tetanic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) of the slices from the transgenic mice was shifted significantly toward smaller values to a degree that 25% of slices exhibited depression. The altered hippocampal neurophysiology was accompanied by an impairment in a hippocampal-dependent learning task. Transgenic mice showed significant impairment in a spatial version of the Morris water maze, however, they performed normally in non-spatial tasks. Probe trials showed that transgenic mice, though significantly impaired, also acquired spatial information. The results suggested that the impairment was not due to motor dysfunction, impaired vision or motivation of the transgenic mice, findings compatible with a possible hippocampal mechanism. We conclude that overexpression of S100 beta in astrocytes impairs, but does not abolish, the ability to solve a spatial task, and it leads to a significantly decreased post-tetanic potentiation in the hippocampal slice. We hypothesize that the changes are due to calcium mediated processes. Our results support the notion that astrocytes are involved in higher brain functions."

An in vitro-transcribed hybrid RNA consisting of an aptamer sequence with high binding specificity to the antibiotic streptomycin and a putative protein-binding RNA sequence is incubated with crude extract. After complex formation, the sample is applied to an affinity column containing streptomycin immobilized to Sepharose. The binding of the in vitro-assembled RNA-protein complex to streptomycin-Sepharose is mediated by the aptamer RNA and the specifically bound proteins are recovered from the affinity matrix by elution with the antibiotic. Employing two well-characterized RNA-protein interactions, we tested the performance of this new method. The spliceosomal U1A protein and the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein could be isolated via their appropriate RNA motif containing hybrid RNA from crude yeast extracts in high yield and purity after only one round of affinity purification. As the purification principle is independent of the extract source, this new affinity chromatography strategy that makes use of an in vitro-selected antibiotic-binding RNA as a tag, ""StreptoTag,"" should be applicable to extracts from other organisms as well. Therefore, we propose StreptoTag to be a versatile tool for the isolation of unknown RNA-binding proteins."

The mouse Oa1 gene encodes a putative protein of 405 amino acids displaying a high level of homology (78% identity, 87% similarity) to the human gene. All disease-associated missense mutations reported in patients with ocular albinism involve conserved amino acid residues in the mouse protein. Moreover, the murine homolog shows six putative transmembrane domains, as observed for the human gene, indicating that the overall structure of the two proteins is conserved. The genomic organization is also conserved between the two species across the entire coding region with splice sites located in the same positions. Like its human counterpart, the expression pattern of Oa1, apart from the eye, is restricted to the epidermal melanocyte lineage. A transcript of approximately 1.8 kb was readily detected by this probe in 5 out of 5 murine melanocyte lines, 4 out of 4 murine melanoblast lines, 1 out of 2 murine melanoma lines, and 1 out of 2 human melanoma lines tested, but it was not detected in 2 out of 2 lines of a developmentally earlier normal cell type, melanoblast precursor cells, suggesting that the gene is transcriptionally activated in epidermal melanocytes at the same stage as most other tested melanosomal proteins. Together, these data suggest that the function of the OA1 gene is conserved between human and mouse and point to the mouse as a model to facilitate the understanding of ocular albinism pathogenesis."

Differentiation of mesoderm to epithelioid cells was accompanied by diminished expression of N-myc. Expression of myc was not an inevitable correlate of cellular proliferation. Instead, the gene appeared to be regulated in concert with changes that affect a diversity of cellular properties, including proliferation, invasiveness, and differentiation."

Recently, a large number of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have been developed against HCV infection, resulting in significant improvements in treatment efficacy. Rapid progress in HCV research has been largely dependent on the development of HCV culture systems and small animal infection models. In the development of HCV cell culture systems, the discovery of the JFH-1 clone, an HCV strain isolated from a fulminant hepatitis C patient, was a key finding. The JFH-1 strain was the first infectious HCV strain belonging to genotype 2a. JFH-1 replicated efficiently in cultured cell lines without acquiring adaptive mutations, providing the secretion of infectious viral particles into the culture medium. Recently, other HCV strains also were reported to be infectious in cultured cells with adaptive viral mutations, but genotype-1b infectious HCV clones and virus culture systems for clinical isolates are still missing. These infectious HCV systems have provided powerful tools to study the viral life cycle, to construct antiviral strategies, and to develop effective vaccines."

Many homeobox genes, including Hox and NK genes, are arranged in gene clusters, a feature likely related to transcriptional control. Sparse taxon sampling and fragmentary genome assemblies mean that little is known about the dynamics of homeobox gene evolution across Lepidoptera or about how changes in homeobox gene number and organization relate to diversity in this large order of insects. Here we analyze an extensive data set of high-quality genomes to characterize the number and organization of all homeobox genes in 123 species of Lepidoptera from 23 taxonomic families. We find most Lepidoptera have around 100 homeobox loci, including an unusual Hox gene cluster in which the lab gene is repositioned and the ro gene is next to pb . A topologically associating domain spans much of the gene cluster, suggesting deep regulatory conservation of the Hox cluster arrangement in this insect order. Most Lepidoptera have four Shx genes, divergent zen -derived loci, but these loci underwent dramatic duplication in several lineages, with some moths having over 165 homeobox loci in the Hox gene cluster; this expansion is associated with local LINE element density. In contrast, the NK gene cluster content is more stable, although there are differences in organization compared with other insects, as well as major rearrangements within butterflies. Our analysis represents the first description of homeobox gene content across the order Lepidoptera, exemplifying the potential of newly generated genome assemblies for understanding genome and gene family evolution."

These memories are contextual in nature, with details of specific features interwoven with more general properties such as the time and place of the event. In this study, we hypothesized that the context in which a memory is embedded would guide the process of consolidation during sleep. To test this idea, we used a spatial memory task and considered changes in memory over a 10-h period including either sleep or wake. In both conditions, participants ( N = 62) formed stories that contextually bound four objects together and then encoded the on-screen spatial position of all objects. Results showed that the changes in memory over the sleep period were correlated among contextually linked objects, whereas no such effect was identified for the wake group. These results demonstrate that context-binding plays an important role in memory consolidation during sleep."
An avian muscle factor related to MyoD1 activates muscle-specific promoters in nonmuscle cells of different germ-layer origin and in BrdU-treated myoblasts.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.7.986,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/7/986,3,7,07/01/1989,986,996,"['Z Y Lin', 'C A Dechesne', 'J Eldridge', 'B M Paterson']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']","We isolated the cDNA encoding a myogenic factor expressed in embryonic chick breast muscle by virtue of its weak hybridization to the mouse MyoD1 clone. Nucleotide sequence analysis and amino acid comparison define this clone, CMD1, as encoding a protein similar to mouse MyoD1. CMD1 encodes a polypeptide smaller than MyoD1, 298 versus 318 amino acids, respectively, and is 80% concordant by amino acid sequence overall. The basic and myc domains required for myogenic conversion of mouse 10T1/2 'fibroblasts' to myoblasts with MyoD1 are completely conserved in CMD1. CMD1 is just as efficient as the mouse homolog in myogenic conversion of 10T1/2 cells and coactivates the endogenous mouse MyoD1 gene in the process. The efficiency of myoblast conversion depends on the levels of CMD1 expression and suggests that the cellular concentration of CMD1 plays a role in the onset of myogenesis. Transient expression of CMD1 in a variety of nonmuscle cells from different germ-layer origins activates both cotransfected muscle-specific promoters and, in some cases, endogenous muscle-specific genes. 5-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) treatment of chicken and mouse myoblasts reduces the expression of CMD1 and MyoD1, respectively, and may explain how this thymidine analog inhibits myogenesis and the activity of transfected muscle-specific promoters in BrdU-treated myoblasts. Transient expression of CMD1 in BrdU-treated myoblasts reactivates cotransfected muscle-specific promoters. CMD1 activates muscle-specific promoters in cotransfections regardless of cell type, whereas 'housekeeping' or constitutive promoters can be activated moderately, unaffected, or repressed, depending on the promoter and cell background. The rate and degree of myogenic conversion may be more restricted by cell phenotype than by germ-layer origin."

Prehoda'],"['Department of Chemistry and Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon 97403']","During Drosophila development, neuroblasts divide to generate progeny with two different fates. One daughter cell self-renews to maintain the neuroblast pool, whereas the other differentiates to populate the central nervous system. The difference in fate arises from the asymmetric distribution of proteins that specify either self-renewal or differentiation, which is brought about by their polarization into separate apical and basal cortical domains during mitosis. Neuroblast symmetry breaking is regulated by numerous proteins, many of which have only recently been discovered. The atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) is a broad regulator of polarity that localizes to the neuroblast apical cortical region and directs the polarization of the basal domain. Recent work suggests that polarity can be explained in large part by the mechanisms that restrict aPKC activity to the apical domain and those that couple asymmetric aPKC activity to the polarization of downstream factors. Polarized aPKC activity is created by a network of regulatory molecules, including Bazooka/Par-3, Cdc42, and the tumor suppressor Lgl, which represses basal recruitment. Direct phosphorylation by aPKC leads to cortical release of basal domain factors, preventing them from occupying the apical domain. In this framework, neuroblast polarity arises from a complex system that orchestrates robust aPKC polarity, which in turn polarizes substrates by coupling phosphorylation to cortical release."

Methods for the analysis of gene presence/absence patterns typically do not account for errors introduced in the automated annotation and clustering of gene sequences. In particular, methods adapted from ecological studies, including the pangenome gene accumulation curve, can be misleading as they may reflect the underlying diversity in the temporal sampling of genomes rather than a difference in the dynamics of HGT. Here, we introduce Panstripe, a method based on generalized linear regression that is robust to population structure, sampling bias, and errors in the predicted presence/absence of genes. We show using simulations that Panstripe can effectively identify differences in the rate and number of genes involved in HGT events, and illustrate its capability by analyzing several diverse bacterial genome data sets representing major human pathogens."

To alleviate this problem, two sequential affinity purification steps are employed in the TAP procedure. Since its inception in yeast, TAP has gone through many adaptations and has been employed multiple times in diverse organisms, including mammalian systems. In all these approaches, two out of many possible affinity moieties are employed and are usually expressed as a fusion polypeptide in the amino or carboxyl-terminal region of the protein bait. In this protocol, we describe a variation on the TAP procedure in which the affinity moieties are placed on two different proteins of a molecular complex to isolate or detect components present in the complex.

The planar cell polarity system, first characterized in Drosophila , is important for many of these events. Studies in Drosophila suggest that an upstream system breaks cellular symmetry by converting tissue gradients to subcellular asymmetry, whereas a downstream system amplifies subcellular asymmetry and communicates polarity between cells. In this review, we discuss apparent similarities and differences in the mechanism that controls PCP as it has been adapted to a broad variety of morphological cellular asymmetries in various organisms."
Effects of oligonucleotide length and atomic composition on stimulation of the ATPase activity of translation initiation factor elF4A.,RNA,RNA,1355-8382,1469-9001,,http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/5/9/1210,5,9,09/01/1999,1210,1221,"['M L Peck', 'D Herschlag']","['Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University, California 94305-5307, USA.']","Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (elF4A) has been proposed to use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to remove RNA structure in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs, helping the 43S ribosomal complex bind to an mRNA and scan to find the 5'-most AUG initiator codon. We have examined the effect of changing the atomic composition and length of single-stranded oligonucleotides on binding to elF4A and on stimulation of its ATPase activity once bound. Substitution of 2'-OH groups with 2'-H or 2'-OCH3 groups reduces ATPase stimulation at least 100-fold, to background levels, without significantly affecting oligonucleotide affinity. These effects suggest that 2'-OH groups participate in an elF4A conformational change that occurs subsequent to oligonucleotide binding and is required for ATPase stimulation. Replacing nonbridging oxygen atoms in phosphodiester linkages with sulfur atoms to make phosphorothioate linkages has no significant effect on stimulation, while substantially increasing affinity. Extending the length of an RNA oligonucleotide from 4 to approximately 15 nt gradually increases oligonucleotide affinity and ATPase stimulation. Consistent with this observation, the increase in affinity and stimulation provided by phosphorothioate linkages and 2'-OH groups is proportional to the number of these groups present within larger oligonucleotides. Further, changing the position of blocks of phosphorothioate linkages or 2'-OH groups within a larger oligonucleotide does not affect affinity and has only a small effect on stimulation. These observations suggest that numerous interactions between the oligonucleotide and elF4A contribute individually to binding and ATPase stimulation. Nevertheless, significant stimulation is observed with as few as four RNA residues. These properties may allow elF4A to operate within regions of 5' UTRs containing only short stretches of exposed single-stranded RNA. As stimulation increases when longer stretches of single-stranded RNA are available, it is possible that the accessibility of single-stranded RNA in a 5' UTR influences translation efficiency."

It was shown previously that the human c-myc gene could be transcribed in vitro and in Xenopus oocytes by both alpha-amanitin-sensitive and alpha-amanitin-resistant polymerases, probably corresponding to polymerase II and polymerase III. We confirmed this observation in microinjected oocytes and showed that the alpha-amanitin-resistant transcription of c-myc was competed by known polymerase III genes. Polymerase III transcription of c-myc was very inefficient compared to other polymerase III genes, however, and was observed only when large amounts of template DNA were injected. At lower DNA concentrations the gene was transcribed, exclusively by polymerase II. In contrast, the adenovirus major late promoter was not transcribed by polymerase III. The 5' ends of polymerase III RNAs were almost indistinguishable from those of polymerase II RNAs initiating at the P1 and P2 promoters of the human and mouse c-myc genes. Furthermore, point mutations in the TATA box of the human P2 promoter greatly reduced polymerase III activity. At this promoter, therefore, polymerase II and polymerase III recognize a common element, the TATA box, which probably plays an important role in specifying the start site of transcription for both polymerases. We suggest that the highly accurate though inefficient mimicry of polymerase II by polymerase III at the c-myc promoters reflects the common evolutionary origin of these two enzymes."

We identified two patients with breast cancer each carrying a pathogenic germline MUTYH variant with a somatic MUTYH copy loss leading to the germline variant being homozygous in the tumor and demonstrating the same somatic signatures. Our results suggest that monoallelic inactivation of MUTYH is not sufficient for C:G>A:T transversion signatures previously linked to MUTYH deficiency to arise ( N = 9), but that biallelic complete loss of MUTYH function can cause such signatures to arise even in tumors not classically seen in MUTYH -associated polyposis ( N = 3).

Certain factors, smoking, EBV infection, and obesity interact with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) risk genes, arguing for a pathogenic pathway involving adaptive immunity.

Carey', 'Craig L. Peterson', 'Stephen T. Smale']",,"Primer extension is a popular method for measuring transcription. Among the methods for start-site mapping in vivo, it is the one most easily adapted for in vitro transcription. Typically, DNA templates bearing activator binding sites are co-incubated with nuclear extracts (which provide the general transcription factors) and the corresponding activators to synthesize mRNA. In some cases, the activator is present in the extract (e.g., Sp1) and templates lacking or containing sites are compared. In the primer extension assay, a 32 P-end-labeled DNA oligonucleotide is annealed to a complementary region in the mRNA and then extended by a reverse transcriptase to the 5′ end of the mRNA. The resulting labeled cDNA is then fractionated and detected on a polyacrylamide/urea gel. The amount of the product is a measure of the transcriptional activation by the activators. Generally, the addition of 0.1 pmol of primer to the extension reaction is sufficient because it will be in vast excess over the amount of mRNA, facilitating quantitative primer hybridization and extension."

This localization coincides with the mRNAs with which it is associated, that is, the animal pole in the egg, and, after fertilization, the regions derived from this part of the egg, and finally the oral ectoderm of the pluteus. Association with the cytoskeleton was shown by the copurification of LP54 in a microtubule preparation.

A fly can be conditioned to avoid one side of a small test chamber if the chamber is heated whenever the fly enters this side. In a subsequent memory test without heat the fly continues to avoid the previously heat-associated side. In this experimental design one cannot exclude that flies mark the heated side by an odor that they subsequently avoid during the test. As a final proof for associative learning in the present experiment, flies are trained in one chamber and tested for learning in another, similar one. Handling in the transfer experiment interferes with memory display, even if the fly is returned to the old chamber instead of a new one. Memory can be reactivated, however, by subjecting the fly to an additional brief training (priming), which is too short to establish significant learning in naive flies. For efficient priming, heat has to be applied to the same side as during training in the old chamber. Only then the fly subsequently shows a side preference and avoids the side of the new chamber, which in the old one had been associated with heat. The two chambers are similar but not identical The transfer experiment therefore raises the question as to what the flies use as spatial reference during training and test. In the light, they can be shown to orientate according to visual landmarks associated with the chamber. In complete darkness, where training and memory scores do not differ from those in the light, they are assumed to use a combination of tactile and idiothetic information for orienting."

L1 antibodies were amnesic when administered at one of two time windows: 30 min pretraining and 5.5-8 hr post-training. No amnesia was apparent if injections were made at times before, between, or after these time windows (-2, +1, +3, +4, or +12 hr relative to training). A fragment of the L1 molecule derived from the external fibronectin domains FN1-5 produced amnesia only when injected at the 5.5-hr timepoint, whereas a fragment of the immunoglubin-like domains Ig I-VI produced amnesia only when injected 30 min prior to training. We have shown previously that long-term memory for the passive avoidance task requires two waves of glycoprotein synthesis, the first occurring immediately after training, and the second some 6 hr thereafter. The glycoprotein synthesis inhibitor 2-deoxygalactose results in amnesia if injected at either time, whereas the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) is specifically involved only in the second wave. The coincidence of the time course of memory disruption resulting from injection of L1 antibodies with that occurring with 2-deoxygalactose supports the hypothesis that establishment of an enduring memory for the experience of passive avoidance training requires two waves of glycoprotein synthesis, each wave being biochemically and functionally discrete. The differential effects of the two L1 fragments suggests that separate mechanisms of synaptic stabilization are involved at the two time points."

Here, we investigated the role of EHMT1 in the oocyte in comparison to EHMT2 using oocyte-specific conditional knockout mouse models ( Ehmt2 cKO, Ehmt1 cKO, Ehmt1/2 cDKO), with ablation from the early phase of oocyte growth. Loss of EHMT1 in Ehmt1 cKO and Ehmt1/2 cDKO oocytes recapitulated meiotic defects observed in the Ehmt2 cKO; however, there was a significant impairment in oocyte maturation and developmental competence in Ehmt1 cKO and Ehmt1/2 cDKO oocytes beyond that observed in the Ehmt2 cKO. Consequently, loss of EHMT1 in oogenesis results, upon fertilization, in mid-gestation embryonic lethality. To identify H3K9 methylation and other meaningful biological changes in each mutant to explore the molecular functions of EHMT1 and EHMT2, we performed immunofluorescence imaging, multi-omics sequencing, and mass spectrometry (MS)–based proteome analyses in cKO oocytes. Although H3K9me1 was depleted only upon loss of EHMT1, H3K9me2 was decreased, and H3K9me2-enriched domains were eliminated equally upon loss of EHMT1 or EHMT2. Furthermore, there were more significant changes in the transcriptome, DNA methylome, and proteome in Ehmt1/2 cDKO than Ehmt2 cKO oocytes, with transcriptional derepression leading to increased protein abundance and local changes in genic DNA methylation in Ehmt1/2 cDKO oocytes. Together, our findings suggest that EHMT1 contributes to local transcriptional repression in the oocyte, partially independent of EHMT2, and is critical for oogenesis and oocyte developmental competence."

Structural mutations (SMs) drive genome evolution and are thought to play major roles in evolutionary adaptation, speciation, and genetic disease, including cancers. Sequencing of mutation accumulation (MA) lines has provided estimates of rates and spectra of single-nucleotide and indel mutations in many species, yet the rate of new SMs is largely unknown. Here, we use long-read sequencing to determine the full mutation spectrum in MA lines derived from two strains (CC-1952 and CC-2931) of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . The SM rate is highly variable between strains and between MA lines, and SMs represent a substantial proportion of all mutations in both strains (CC-1952 6%; CC-2931 12%). The SM spectra differ considerably between the two strains, with almost all inversions and translocations occurring in CC-2931 MA lines. This variation is associated with heterogeneity in the number and type of active transposable elements (TEs), which comprise major proportions of SMs in both strains (CC-1952 22%; CC-2931 38%). In CC-2931, a Crypton and a previously undescribed type of DNA element have caused 71% of chromosomal rearrangements, whereas in CC-1952, a Dualen LINE is associated with 87% of duplications. Other SMs, notably large duplications in CC-2931, are likely products of various double-strand break repair pathways. Our results show that diverse types of SMs occur at substantial rates, and support prominent roles for SMs and TEs in evolution."
Identification and characterization of a novel high affinity metal-binding site in the hammerhead ribozyme.,RNA,RNA,1355-8382,1469-9001,,http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/5/8/1099,5,8,08/01/1999,1099,1104,"['M R Hansen', 'J P Simorre', 'P Hanson', 'V Mokler', 'L Bellon', 'L Beigelman', 'A Pardi']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado at Boulder, 80309-0215, USA.']","A novel metal-binding site has been identified in the hammerhead ribozyme by 31P NMR. The metal-binding site is associated with the A13 phosphate in the catalytic core of the hammerhead ribozyme and is distinct from any previously identified metal-binding sites. 31P NMR spectroscopy was used to measure the metal-binding affinity for this site and leads to an apparent dissociation constant of 250-570 microM at 25 degrees C for binding of a single Mg2+ ion. The NMR data also show evidence of a structural change at this site upon metal binding and these results are compared with previous data on metal-induced structural changes in the core of the hammerhead ribozyme. These NMR data were combined with the X-ray structure of the hammerhead ribozyme (Pley HW, Flaherty KM, McKay DB. 1994. Nature 372:68-74) to model RNA ligands involved in binding the metal at this A13 site. In this model, the A13 metal-binding site is structurally similar to the previously identified A(g) metal-binding site and illustrates the symmetrical nature of the tandem G x A base pairs in domain 2 of the hammerhead ribozyme. These results demonstrate that 31P NMR represents an important method for both identification and characterization of metal-binding sites in nucleic acids."

While the Crm1-dependent pathway used by complex retroviruses to export incompletely spliced viral transcripts is now fairly well understood, less is known about how simple retroviruses accomplish this task. However, the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) has been shown to encode a structured RNA sequence, termed the constitutive transport element (CTE), that recruits a cellular RNA export factor termed Tap. Here we demonstrate that a CTE previously proposed to be present in the avian sarcoma/leukemia (ASV/ALV) family of retroviruses indeed functions as a potent RNA export signal. We have mapped single- and double-stranded regions present in the ASV/ALV CTE in vitro and report that this CTE is predicted to fold into a structure bearing three distinct RNA stem-loops. However, only the central stem-loop is critical for CTE function and this 69-nt structure is, in fact, sufficient when present as a dimer. While the ASV/ALV CTE is shown to function independently of Crm1, as also previously reported for the MPMV CTE, it lacks any evident sequence homology to the highly conserved MPMV CTE sequence. Together, these data define the secondary structure and biological activity of an avian CTE sequence that may access a novel nuclear RNA export pathway."

Neurons have axonal and dendritic cytoplasmic extensions containing synapses whose plasticity is regulated efficiently by mRNA transport and localized translation. The principles behind these mechanisms are equally attractive for explaining rapid local regulation of distal glial cytoplasmic projections, independent of their cell nucleus. However, in contrast to neurons, mRNA localization has received little experimental attention in glia. Nevertheless, there are many functionally diverse glial subtypes containing extensive networks of long cytoplasmic projections with likely localized regulation that influence neurons and their synapses. Moreover, glia have many other neuron-like properties, including electrical activity, secretion of gliotransmitters and calcium signaling, influencing, for example, synaptic transmission, plasticity and axon pruning. Here, we review previous studies concerning glial transcripts with important roles in influencing synaptic plasticity, focusing on a few cases involving localized translation. We discuss a variety of important questions about mRNA transport and localized translation in glia that remain to be addressed, using cutting-edge tools already available for neurons."

Here, we apply SHAPE to investigate RNA-mediated binding processes in RNA:RNA and RNA:RNA-RBP complexes. We use R NA:RN A  b inding by S HAPE (RABS) to investigate microRNA-34a ( miR-34a ) binding its mRNA target, the silent information regulator 1 (m SIRT1 ), both with and without the Argonaute protein, constituting the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). We show that the seed of the mRNA target must be bound to the microRNA loaded into RISC to enable further binding of the compensatory region by RISC, while the naked miR-34a is able to bind the compensatory region without seed interaction. The method presented here provides complementary structural evidence for the commonly performed luciferase-assay-based evaluation of microRNA binding-site efficiency and specificity on the mRNA target site and could therefore be used in conjunction with it. The method can be applied to any nucleic acid-mediated RNA- or RBP-binding process, such as splicing, antisense RNA binding, or regulation by RISC, providing important insight into the targeted RNA structure."

The cilium, being an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitous organelle implied in many cellular functions, can be investigated by way of many models from invertebrate models to nonhuman primates, all these models have massively contributed to the pathogenesis understanding of human ciliopathies. Taking the Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS) as an emblematic example as well as other related syndromic ciliopathies, the contribution of a wide range of models has enabled to characterize the role of the BBS proteins in the archetypical cilium but also at the level of the connecting cilium of the photoreceptors. There are more than 24 BBS genes encoding for proteins that form different complexes such as the BBSome and the chaperone proteins complex. But how they lead to retinal degeneration remains a matter of debate with the possible accumulation of proteins in the inner segment and/or accumulation of unwanted proteins in the outer segment that cannot return in the inner segment machinery. Many BBS proteins (but not the chaperonins for instance) can be modeled in primitive organisms such as Paramecium , Chlamydomonas reinardtii , Trypanosoma brucei , and Caenorhabditis elegans . These models have enabled clarifying the role of a subset of BBS proteins in the primary cilium as well as their relations with other modules such as the intraflagellar transport (IFT) module, the nephronophthisis (NPHP) module, or the Meckel–Gruber syndrome (MKS)/Joubert syndrome (JBTS) module mostly involved with the transition zone of the primary cilia. Assessing the role of the primary cilia structure of the connecting cilium of the photoreceptor cells has been very much studied by way of zebrafish modeling ( Danio rerio ) as well as by a plethora of mouse models. More recently, large animal models have been described for three BBS genes and one nonhuman primate model in rhesus macaque for BBS7 . In completion to animal models, human cell models can now be used notably thanks to gene editing and the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). All these models are not only important for pathogenesis understanding but also very useful for studying therapeutic avenues, their pros and cons, especially for gene replacement therapy as well as pharmacological triggers."

Most kinetoplast-transcribed mRNAs are cryptic and encode multiple subunits for the electron transport chain following maturation through a uridine insertion/deletion process called RNA editing. This process is achieved through an enzyme cascade by an RNA editing catalytic complex (RECC), where the final ligation step is catalyzed by the kinetoplastid RNA editing ligases, KREL1 and KREL2. While the amino-terminal domain (NTD) of these proteins is highly conserved with other DNA ligases and mRNA capping enzymes, with five recognizable motifs, the functional role of their diverged carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) has remained elusive. In this manuscript, we assayed recombinant KREL1 in vitro to unveil critical residues from its CTD to be involved in protein–protein interaction and dsRNA ligation activity. Our data show that the α-helix (H)3 of KREL1 CTD interacts with the αH1 of its editosome protein partner KREPA2. Intriguingly, the OB-fold domain and the zinc fingers on KREPA2 do not appear to influence the RNA ligation activity of KREL1. Moreover, a specific KWKE motif on the αH4 of KREL1 CTD is found to be implicated in ligase auto-adenylylation analogous to motif VI in DNA ligases. In summary, we present in the KREL1 CTD a motif VI for auto-adenylylation and a KREPA2 binding motif for RECC integration."

We further confirmed that a significant memory deficit occurred subsequent to this deafferentation of the hippocampus in untreated animals. In contrast, the effect of caerulein, but not that of L-365,260, was abolished following a bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. These results demonstrate that the hippocampal system plays a role in olfactory recognition and indicate that distinct neuronal pathways underlie the memory-enhancing effects of CCK-A and CCK-B drugs observed in the olfactory recognition test. The former effects (CCK-A) appear to involve a peripheral relay to the brain via the vagus nerve, whereas the latter (CCK-B) are directly central and involve, at least in part, the hippocampal system."

New cost-effective methods to locate the genes and to characterize disease-causing mutations require robust, reproducible, and accurate protocols for measuring DNA fragment lengths. Capillary array electrophoresis (CAE) offers rapid, high-resolution separations, high throughput, and sensitive detection. To assess the utility of CAE for the accumulation of genetic information, we tested both sizing accuracy and reproducibility using 48-capillary prototype systems. Two multiplex PCR allelic ladder standards and several CA-repeat markers were analyzed in > 100 runs. Reproducibility in typing > 8000 genotypes reveals a standard deviation of less than 0.2 bp on these systems under optimized conditions. However, sequence-dependent migration anomalies were observed at most simple sequence loci even when analyzed under denaturing conditions, resulting in a systematic bias in estimated fragment sizes. We show here that, by normalizing results to known typing controls, one can obtain locus-averaged accuracies of < 0.06 bp and normalized results within 1 bp of actual. We detect as little as a 1:30,000 dilution of a DNA quantitation standard stained with highly sensitive intercalating dyes, indicating an 80-zeptomole sensitivity limit. However, to obtain reproducible electrokinetic injection, approximately 200 attomoles of fluorescein-labeled DNA is required. These sensitivity limits, sizing precision, and accuracy, together with the 1-hr run times for 48-96 samples, indicate that CAE is a viable method for high-throughput genetic analysis of simple sequence repeat polymorphisms."

N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-APV, 50 or 100 microM) reduced the homosynaptic LTP by 80% but failed to affect heterosynaptic LTP.

The inhibitor of Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release dantrolene (20 microM), also applied with DL-APV, blocked both components of LTP. Importantly, when low-frequency test stimulation (0.017 Hz) to the untetanized, heterosynaptic pathway was interrupted for 30 min after homosynaptic tetanization, heterosynaptic LTP did not develop. These results demonstrate homosynaptic and heterosynaptic LTP inductions in stratum oriens of the area CA1 and suggest that the heterosynaptic LTP is induced by NMDA-independent, novel associative processes between tetanized and untetanized pathways."

However, efforts in understanding the functions of these proteins have been hampered by the inability to obtain their mRNA substrates. To identify cognate cellular mRNAs associated with an RNA-binding protein, we devised a strategy termed isolation of specific nucleic acids associated with proteins (SNAAP). The SNAAP technique allows isolation and subsequent identification of these mRNAs. To assess the validity of this approach, we utilized cellular mRNA and protein from K562 cells and alphaCP1, a protein implicated in a-globin mRNA stability, as a model system. Immobilization of an RNA-binding protein with the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) domain enables isolation of mRNA within an mRNP context and the identity of the bound mRNAs is determined by the differential display assay. The specificity of protein-RNA interactions was considerably enhanced when the interactions were carried out in the presence of cellular extract rather than purified components. Two of the mRNAs specifically bound by alphaCP1 were mRNAs encoding the transmembrane receptor protein, TAPA-1, and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II enzyme, coxII. A specific poly(C)-sensitive complex formed on the TAPA-1 and coxII 3' UTRs consistent with the binding of aCP1.

When tested in cultured hepatoma cells, the C/EBP expression vector achieved potent trans-activation of the albumin promoter. Less substantial activation was observed when the same experiment was conducted using cultured mouse fibroblasts. Expression vectors that encoded defective forms of C/EBP failed to activate the albumin promoter. Moreover, mutated variants of the albumin promoter that lack the C/EBP-binding site failed to be trans-activated. The data are consistent with the interpretation that C/EBP is a bona fide transcription factor. During the course of these experiments it was noted also that C/EBP is more than an order of magnitude less concentrated in cultured hepatoma cells than it is in adult liver cells. Given these findings, we speculate that C/EBP may play a general role in establishing and maintaining the differentiated, nonproliferative state."

HAV is remarkably stealthy because of its ability to evade and disrupt innate signaling pathways that lead to interferon production. In contrast, HEV does not block interferon production. Instead, it persists in the presence of an interferon response. These differences may provide insight into HEV persistence in immunocompromised patients, an emerging health problem in developed countries."

This discovery quickly led to blood tests that eliminated posttransfusion hepatitis C and could show the partial efficacy of type 1 interferon-based therapies. Subsequent knowledge of the viral replication cycle then led to the development of effective direct-acting antivirals targeting its serine protease, polymerase, and nonstructural protein 5A that resulted in the approval of orally available drug combinations that can cure patients within a few months with few side effects. Meanwhile, vaccine strategies have been shown to be feasible, and they are still required to effectively control this global epidemic."

Scar tissue effectively and quickly restores the mechanical integrity of lost tissue architecture but comes at the price of lost tissue functionality. Fibrotic diseases caused by excessive or persistent myofibroblast activity can lead to organ failure. This review defines myofibroblast terminology, phenotypic characteristics, and functions. We will focus on the central role of the cell, ECM, and tissue mechanics in regulating tissue repair by controlling myofibroblast action. Additionally, we will discuss how therapies based on mechanical intervention potentially ameliorate wound healing outcomes. Although myofibroblast physiology and pathology affect all organs, we will emphasize cutaneous wound healing and hypertrophic scarring as paradigms for normal tissue repair versus fibrosis. A central message of this review is that myofibroblasts can be activated from multiple cell sources, varying with local environment and type of injury, to either restore tissue integrity and organ function or create an inappropriate mechanical environment."

IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF3), the positive regulator of transcription, was derived in response to IFN alpha treatment from preexisting protein components that were activated first in the cell cytoplasm prior to appearance in the nucleus. Nuclear translocation of ISGF3 required several minutes and could be inhibited by NaF. Formation of active ISGF3 was mimicked in vitro by mixing cytoplasmic extracts from IFN alpha-stimulated cells with extracts of cells treated to contain high amounts of the unactivated factor. Active ISGF3 was found to be formed from association of two latent polypeptide precursors that were distinguished biochemically by differential sensitivity to N-ethyl maleimide. One precursor was modified in response to IFN alpha occupation of its cell-surface receptor, thus enabling association with the second subunit. The resulting complex then was competent for nuclear translocation and binding to ISRE. Cytoplasmically localized transcription factor precursors thus serve as second messengers to translate directly an extracellular signal into specific transcriptional activity in the nucleus."

Immunofluorescent labeling of neurons expressing deleted Ddc genes indicates that this region contains both general neuronal regulatory elements and cell-specific elements that selectively affect Ddc expression in either dopaminergic or serotonergic neurons. These selective effects can be correlated with the removal of sequence elements that are protected from DNase digestion by factors present in embryonic nuclear extracts. Several of these elements are also homologous to sequences located upstream of the evolutionarily diverged Ddc gene of Drosophila virilis.

In S. cerevisiae , it is a trivial matter to determine whether a modified version of a protein is functional. This is accomplished by testing whether the tagged protein can complement a null phenotype or rescue a conditional phenotype. Methods such as indirect immunofluorescence and the use of green fluorescent protein (GFP) allow the investigator to correlate the intracellular localization of the protein with its function in vivo. This article includes a detailed protocol for performing indirect immunofluorescence with S. cerevisiae . Cells are grown exponentially and then fixed. After fixation, an enzyme is used to remove the cell wall, and the cells are adhered to slides.

The dominant pattern, a ring of adhesion molecules surrounding a central cluster of antigen receptors, was observed in both model systems. Analysis of the origins of this pattern over the past 10 years has presented a solution for a difficult problem in lymphocyte biology—how a highly motile cell can suddenly stop when it encounters a signal delivered by just a few antigenic ligands on the surface of another cell without disabling the sensory machinery of the motile cell. The T lymphocyte actively assembles the immunological synapse pattern following a modular design with roots in actin–myosin‐based motility."

To study the molecular mechanisms underlying 3' cleavage of pre-mRNAs, we fractionated CSF further and show that it consists of four separable subunits. One of these, called specificity factor (SF; Mr, approximately 290,000), is required for both specific cleavage and for specific polyadenylation and thus appears responsible for the specificity of the reaction. Although SF has not been purified to homogeneity, several lines of evidence suggest that it may not contain an essential RNA component. Two other factors, designated cleavage factors I (CFI; Mr, approximately 130,000) and II (CFII; Mr, approximately 110,000), are sufficient to reconstitute accurate cleavage when mixed with SF. A fourth factor, termed cleavage stimulation factor (CstF; Mr, approximately 200,000), enhances cleavage efficiency significantly when added to a mixture of the three other factors. CFI, CFII, and CstF do not contain RNA components, nor do they affect specific polyadenylation in the absence of cleavage. Although these four factors are necessary and sufficient to reconstitute efficient cleavage of one pre-RNA tested, poly(A) polymerase is also required to cleave several others.

The distribution of eNOS within CA1 cells is not uniform, however, being present in the cell bodies and apical dendrites but absent from the basal dendrites. Using extracellular and intracellular recording techniques, we demonstrate that LTP induction in stratum radiatum synapses (onto apical dendrites) is dependent on NO production, being attenuated by pretreatment with a NOS inhibitor. LTP induced in stratum oriens synapses (onto basal dendrites) is, however, resistant to NOS inhibitors. Both forms of LTP require the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors because induction of LTP in both stratum radiatum and stratum oriens is blocked by AP5. Thus, it appears that synapses onto apical and basal dendrites of CA1 cells use different cellular mechanisms of LTP induction."

We completed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 11 unique tumor samples obtained from a rapid research autopsy on a patient with FGFR-fusion-positive cholangiocarcinoma who initially responded to the pan-FGFR inhibitor, INCB054828. In vitro studies were carried out to characterize the novel FGFR alteration and secondary FGFR2 mutation identified. Multisite WES and analysis of tumor heterogeneity through subclonal inference identified four genetically distinct cancer cell populations, two of which were only observed after treatment. Additionally, WES revealed an FGFR2 N549H mutation hypothesized to confer resistance to the FGFR inhibitor INCB054828 in a single tumor sample. This hypothesis was corroborated with in vitro cell-based studies in which cells expressing FGFR2–CLIP1 fusion were sensitive to INCB054828 (IC 50 value of 10.16 nM), whereas cells with the addition of the N549H mutation were resistant to INCB054828 (IC 50 value of 1527.57 nM). Furthermore, the FGFR2 N549H secondary mutation displayed cross-resistance to other selective FGFR inhibitors, but remained sensitive to the nonselective inhibitor, ponatinib. Rapid research autopsy has the potential to provide unprecedented insights into the clonal evolution of cancer throughout the course of the disease.

The downstream element is included in a region of enhanced DNase I reactivity at 10- to 11-bp intervals for approximately 140 bp, presumably because of DNA wrapping around a specifically positioned nucleosome particle. The two other proximal DNA elements appear to be mostly melted, with a protecting factor bound primarily to the template DNA strand. The protecting factor directly borders the wrapped particle. These observations provide an initial description of parts of the biological transcription machinery and suggest that the SV40 major late promoter elements are part of a higher order nucleoprotein complex that involves wrapped and melted DNA."
Modification of hippocampal synaptic proteins by nitric oxide-stimulated ADP ribosylation.,Learning & Memory,Learn.

To better understand the potential mechanisms by which NO regulates synaptic function, the ability of NO to stimulate the modification of synaptic proteins by ADP ribosylation was examined. Two NO donors, sodium nitroprusside and 3-morpholinosydnonimine, stimulated the ADP ribosylation of proteins at apparent molecular masses of 42, 48, 51, 54, and 74 kD in hippocampal synaptosomes. This stimulation was likely owing to the production of NO by the donors; ADP ribosylation was not stimulated by non-NO decomposition products of sodium nitroprusside, and quenching of superoxide anion did not inhibit Sin-1-induced ADP ribosylation. Experiments using NAD+ that was radiolabeled on the nicotinamide moiety demonstrated that the modification of proteins of molecular masses of 30, 33, and 38 kD are not true ADP ribosylation, whereas labeling of the 42-, 48-, 51-, 54-, and 74-kD proteins likely represent ADP ribosylation. Some of the substrates were brain specific (54 and 74 kD), whereas others (42 and 51 kD) were present in multiple nonbrain tissues."

Balancers constitute an invaluable tool in the C. elegans scientific community and have been widely used for decades. The first/traditional balancers were created by applying X-rays, UV, or gamma radiation on C. elegans strains, generating random genomic rearrangements. Their structures have been mostly explored with low-resolution genetic techniques (e.g., fluorescence in situ hybridization or PCR), before genomic mapping and molecular characterization through sequencing became feasible. As a result, the precise nature of most chromosomal rearrangements remains unknown, whereas, more recently, balancers have been engineered using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique for which the structure of the chromosomal rearrangement has been predesigned. Using short-read whole-genome sequencing (srWGS) and tailored bioinformatic analyses, we previously interpreted the structure of four chromosomal balancers randomly created by mutagenesis processes. Here, we have extended our analyses to five CRISPR-Cas9 balancers and 17 additional traditional balancing rearrangements. We detected and experimentally validated their breakpoints and have interpreted the balancer structures. Many of the balancers were found to be more intricate than previously described, being composed of complex genomic rearrangements (CGRs) such as chromoanagenesis-like events. Furthermore, srWGS revealed additional structural variants and CGRs not known to be part of the balancer genomes. Altogether, our study provides a comprehensive resource of complex genomic variations in C. elegans and highlights the power of srWGS to study the complexity of genomes by applying tailored analyses."

As a result, addition of the label is unlikely to influence microbial growth rates in soil directly, and microbial communities can be exposed to the label for long periods of time because they are not exposed to abnormally high substrate concentrations. Because all organisms incorporate water into their DNA, performing SIP with H 2 18 O is a method for identifying microorganisms that have grown during incubation with H 2 18 O, as well as microorganisms that have not grown (i.e., did not incorporate the label) but survived the incubation.

Here, we investigated how AS functions in poplar ( Populus trichocarpa ), a popular plant for bioremediation, in response to lead (Pb) stress. Using a proteogenomic analysis, we determine that Pb stress induced alterations in AS patterns that are characterized by an increased use of nonconventional splice sites and a higher abundance of Pb-responsive splicing factors (SFs) associated with Pb-responsive transcription factors. A strong Pb(II)-inducible chaperone protein, PtHSP70, that undergoes AS was further characterized. Overexpression of its two spliced isoforms, PtHSP70-AS1 and PtHSP70-AS2, in poplar and Arabidopsis significantly enhances the tolerance to Pb. Further characterization shows that both isoforms can directly bind to Pb(II), and PtHSP70-AS2 exhibits 10-fold higher binding capacities and a greater increase in expression under Pb stress, thereby reducing cellular toxicity through Pb(II) extrusion and conferring Pb tolerance. AS of PtHSP70 is found to be regulated by PtU1-70K, a Pb(II)-inducible core SF involved in 5′-splice site recognition. Because the same splicing pattern is also found in HSP70 orthologs in other plant species, AS of HSP70 may be a common regulatory mechanism to cope with Pb(II) toxicity. Overall, we have revealed a novel post-transcriptional machinery that mediates heavy metal tolerance in diverse plant species. Our findings offer new molecular targets and bioengineering strategies for phytoremediation and provide new insight for future directions in AS research."

Poly(A) elongation during Xenopus oocyte maturation is required for translational recruitment and is mediated by a short sequence element.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.6.803,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/6/803,3,6,06/01/1989,803,815,"['L L McGrew', 'E Dworkin-Rastl', 'M B Dworkin', 'J D Richter']","['Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, Shrewsbury, Massachusetts 01545.']","Xenopus oocytes contain several mRNAs that are mobilized into polysomes only at the completion of meiosis (maturation) or at specific times following fertilization. To investigate the mechanisms that control translation during early development, we have focused on an mRNA, termed G10, that is recruited for translation during oocyte maturation. Coincident with its translation, the poly(A) tail of this message is elongated from approximately 90 to 200 adenylate residues. To identify the cis sequence that is required for this cytoplasmic adenylation and recruitment, we have synthesized wild-type and deletion mutant G10 mRNAs with SP6 polymerase. When injected into oocytes that subsequently were induced to mature with progesterone, wild-type G10 mRNA, but not mutant transcripts lacking a 50-base sequence in the 3'-untranslated region, was polyadenylated and recruited for translation. The 50-base sequence was sufficient to confer polyadenylation and translation when fused to globin mRNA, which does not normally undergo these processes during oocyte maturation. Further mutational analysis of this region revealed that a U-rich sequence 5' to the AAUAAA hexanucleotide nuclear polyadenylation signal, as well as the hexanucleotide itself, were both required for polyadenylation and translation. The 50-base cis element directs polyadenylation, but not translation per se, as a transcript that terminates with 3'-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin) is not recruited for translation. The available data suggest that the dynamic process of polyadenylation, and not the length of the poly(A) tail, is required for translational recruitment during oocyte maturation."

The features that allow G x U recognition are likely to include direct interaction of alanyl-tRNA synthetase with distinctive atomic groups and indirect recognition of the structural and stability information encoded in the sequence of G x U and its immediate context. The present work investigates the thermodynamic stability and acceptor activity for a comprehensive set of variant RNAs with substitutions of the G x U pair of E. coli tRNA(Ala). The four RNAs with Watson-Crick substitutions had a lower acceptor activity and a higher stability relative to the G x U RNA. On the other hand, the RNAs with mispair substitutions had a lower stability, but either a higher or a lower acceptor activity. Thus, the entire set of variant RNAs does not exhibit a correlation between thermodynamic stability of the free, unbound tRNA and its acceptor activity. The substantial acceptor activity of tRNAs with particular mispair substitutions may be explained by their ability to assume the conformational preferences of alanyl-tRNA synthetase. Moreover, the G x U pair may provide a point of deformability for the substrate tRNA to adapt to the enzyme's active site."

The binding site for this factor is required for efficient transcription of the H2B-2.1 gene both in vitro in nuclear extracts of gastrula embryos and in vivo in microinjected sea urchin embryos. This factor binds with equal affinity to the recognition sequences of all four histone genes in cross-competition assays. Moreover, the binding site of the H2B-2.2 promoter can functionally substitute for that of the H2B-2.1 gene in in vivo expression experiments. Nevertheless, all four binding sites share little sequence homology with each other. This transcription factor increases in abundance during embryogenesis and has been detected in the adult sea urchin only in the tube feet, where the late H2A-2 and H2B-2 genes are expressed specifically. Therefore, we refer to this factor as tissue-specific activator protein (TSAP). The close correlation between the presence of TSAP and the expression pattern of the late H2A-2 and H2B-2 genes suggests that this transcription factor is directly responsible for the developmental and tissue-specific regulation of these genes."

The model illustrates how a central pattern generator in cortex and basal ganglia, a neuromuscular force controller in spinal cord, and an adaptive cerebellum cooperate to reduce motor variability during multijoint arm movements using mono- and bi-articular muscles. Cerebellar learning modifies velocity commands to produce phasic antagonist bursts at interpositus nucleus cells whose feed-forward action overcomes inherent limitations of spinal feedback control of tracking. Excitation of alpha motoneuron pools, combined with inhibition of their Renshaw cells by the cerebellum, facilitate movement initiation and optimal execution. Transcerebellar pathways are opened by learning through long-term depression (LTD) of parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses in response to conjunctive stimulation of parallel fibers and climbing fiber discharges that signal muscle stretch errors. The cerebellar circuitry also learns to control opponent muscles pairs, allowing cocontraction and reciprocal inhibition of muscles. Learning is stable, exhibits load compensation properties, and generalizes better across movement speeds if motoneuron pools obey the size principle. The intermittency of climbing fiber discharges maintains stable learning. Long-term potentiation (LTP) in response to uncorrelated parallel fiber signals enables previously weakened synapses to recover. Loss of climbing fibers, in the presence of LTP, can erode normal opponent signal processing. Simulated lesions of the cerebellar network reproduce symptoms of cerebellar disease, including sluggish movement onsets, poor execution of multijoint plans, and abnormally prolonged endpoint oscillations."

Of the 25 clones analyzed in this way, 64% showed length variation between Mus musculus spp. and Mus spretus, and 32% showed variation between Mus musculus musculus-derived standard laboratory inbred strains. Where variation was detected (17 repeat-containing clones in all), the gene was mapped by linkage analysis. None of the repeats isolated showed any signs of extreme expansion. However, two of the repeats were shown to have undergone size changes during the establishment of a number of recombinant inbred strains, suggesting that these repeats are at least moderately unstable."

A small group of RIPs (cofactor-dependent RIPs) require ATP and tRNA to reach maximal activity on isolated ribosomes. Among cofactor-dependent RIPs, gelonin is specifically and uniquely stimulated by tRNA(Trp). The active species are avian (chicken) and mammalian (beef, rat, and rabbit) tRNA(Trp), whereas yeast tRNA(Trp) is completely devoid of stimulating activity. In the present article, bovine and yeast tRNA(Trp) with unmodified bases were prepared by assembly of the corresponding genes from synthetic oligonucleotides followed by PCR and T7 RNA polymerase transcription of the amplified products. The two synthetic tRNAs were fully active (bovine) or inactive (yeast) as the wild-type tRNAs. Construction of chimeric tRNA(Trp) transcripts identified the following bovine nucleotides as recognition elements for gelonin-stimulating activity: G26 and bp G12-C23 in the D arm and G57, A59, and bp G51-C63 and U52-A62 in the T arm. Among single-stranded nucleotides, A59 has a prominent role, but full expression of the gelonin-stimulating activity requires an extensive cooperation between nucleotides in both arms."
Suppression of c-fos induction in rat brain impairs retention of a brightness discrimination reaction.,Learning & Memory,Learn.

The functional relevance of inducible transcription factors for learning and memory formation is, however, not clear. To address this question in the present study, we have used a synthetic antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide to suppress in vivo the expression of c-fos in rat brain. Intrahippocampal application of the oligodeoxynucleotide 10 hr and 2 hr before starting a brightness discrimination training drastically reduced the induction of c-Fos immunoreactivity normally observed in limbic and cortical areas after the training session. Acquisition of the discrimination reaction was not affected by this treatment. In a relearning test 24 hr after the first training, retention of the discrimination reaction was specifically impaired compared with rats pretreated with control oligodeoxynucleotide or saline. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the inducible transcription factor c-Fos is involved in processes underlying the formation of long-term memory."
Retinoic acid receptor expression vector inhibits differentiation of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.11.1647,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/11/1647,3,11,11/01/1989,1647,1656,"['A S Espeseth', 'S P Murphy', 'E Linney']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, North Carolina 27710.']","Expression vectors have been constructed for a region of the human retinoic acid receptor-alpha (hRAR-alpha) and transferred into F9 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. When the vectors are overexpressed in F9 cells, clones can be selected for resistance to retinoic acid-induced differentiation. This effect is obtained even when the hRAR-alpha region is expressed as a beta-galactosidase fusion protein. Using the beta-galactosidase component of the fusion protein as a marker, overexpression of the fusion protein has been correlated with the retinoic acid-resistance effect. The clones resistant to retinoic acid no longer exhibit the normal retinoic acid induction of endo B cytokeratin, laminin B-1, and tissue plasminogen activator mRNAs observed with normal F9 cells. Retinoic acid induction of type IV alpha-1 collagen and Hox-1.3 RNAs is observed with these clones. When transfected with a thyroid receptor DNA-binding sequence (TRE)/thymidine kinase promoter/luciferase construct, the retinoic acid-resistant clones do not yield the same retinoic acid-induced level of luciferase obtained with F9 cells. It is hypothesized that the RAR vectors are interfering with endogenous RAR(s) in a dominant-negative manner to inhibit retinoic acid-induced differentiation of F9 EC cells."

The latter method permits the selective inhibition of zygotic mRNAs in cases in which the gene in question is expressed in both the egg and embryo. Although injection is usually performed at the one-cell stage, it is possible to target individual blastomeres, up to the eight-cell stage, thereby permitting lineage-specific knockdown of pleiotropic genes. Injection can also be performed in unfertilized eggs to inhibit maternal genes. Microinjection also permits DiI labeling and lineage tracing."

An increased polyglutamine chain size leads to a more severe disease, thus correlating with the genetic anticipation seen in repeat expansion disorders. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia with anticipation and a progressive degeneration of the cerebellar cortex. Using repeat expansion detection (RED), a method in which a thermostable ligase is used to detect repeat expansions directly from genomic DNA, we have analyzed 8 SCA7 families for the presence of CAG repeat expansions. RED products of 150-240 bp were found in all affected individuals and found to cosegregate with the disease (P < 0.000001, n = 66), indicating strongly that a CAG expansion is the cause of SCA7. On the basis of a previously established correlation between RED product sizes and actual repeat sizes in Machado-Joseph disease, we were able to estimate the average expansion size in SCA7 to be 64 CAG copies."
Differential patterns of c-fos mRNA expression in amygdala during successive stages of odor discrimination learning.,Learning & Memory,Learn.

In situ hybridization was used to evaluate c-fos mRNA content within the amygdalar subdivisions, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the hippocampus. After initial exploration of the test apparatus, c-fos mRNA levels were increased in the medial and, to lesser extent, basolateral subdivisions and remained low in the central division. The balance of amygdala to hippocampal labeling favored hippocampus. Rats engaged in familiar nose-poke responses had comparably elevated labeling in the medial and basolateral divisions and low labeling densities in the central division. The ratio of hippocampal to amygdala labeling was at control levels. Rats required to switch from ad libitum responding to cued responding to odors had high basolateral to medial labeling ratios. This was in marked contrast to the medial dominance found in control and exploration rats. Hybridization was substantially more dense in basolateral amygdala than in hippocampal CA1; this imbalance was unique to the group required to form first associations between odors and rewards. Rats performing an overtrained odor discrimination had the least differentiation between amygdalar subdivisions of any behavioral group. The hippocampus-to-amygdala labeling ratio favored hippocampus and was nearly identical to the ratio in exploration rats. These results demonstrate that the balance of activity within the between limbic structures shifts according to behavioral demands. It is suggested that the balances reflect the availability of pertinent afferent cues, interactions between hippocampus and the extended amygdala, and relative levels of activity in the diffuse projections to the limbic system."

The quantity and quality of this organelle are controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy (termed “ER-phagy”). ER-phagy is defined as the degradation of part of the ER by the vacuole or lysosomes, and there are at least two types of ER-phagy: macro-ER-phagy and micro-ER-phagy. In macro-ER-phagy, ER fragments are enclosed by autophagosomes, which is mediated by ER-phagy receptors. In micro-ER-phagy, a portion of the ER is engulfed directly by the vacuole or lysosomes. In these two pathways, some proteins in the ER lumen can be recognized selectively and subjected to ER-phagy. This review summarizes our current knowledge of ER-phagy, focusing on its membrane dynamics, molecular mechanisms, substrate specificity, and physiological significance."

One hundred thirty-three trapped sequences were mapped, and every one mapped back to chromosome 21. We estimate that we have identified portions of up to approximately 40% of all genes on chromosome 21. The genic map of chromosome 21 provides a valuable tool for the elucidation of function of the genes and will enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of Down syndrome and other disorders of chromosome 21 genes."

This late development allows transplants to grow and survive in the recipient for at least 150 d without the use of immunosuppressants. The immaturity of the organ systems and the tiny size of the neonate pose difficulties for anesthesia. However, because the pouch young are completely heterothermic until at least 3 mo of age, cooling can be used as an anesthetic agent. In practice, however, we use hypothermia for neonates and young up to the age of 25-30 d, and injectable anethetics thereafter. Healing is remarkably rapid. This tolerance of xenografts and the ability and ease with which hypothermia can be applied to marsupial young provides a unique approach to understanding developmental processes that normally take place in utero in eutherians.

SECp43, identified from a degenerate PCR screen, is a highly conserved protein with two ribonucleoprotein-binding domains and a polar/acidic carboxy terminus. The protein and corresponding mRNA are generally expressed in rat tissues and mammalian cell lines. To gain insight into the biological role of SECp43, affinity-purified antibody was employed to identify its molecular partners. Surprisingly, the application of native HeLa cell extracts to a SECp43 antibody column results in the purification of a 90-nt RNA species identified by direct sequencing and Northern blot analysis as tRNA(Sec). The purification of tRNA(Sec) by the antibody column is striking, based on the low abundance of this tRNA species. Using recombinant SECp43 as a probe for interacting protein partners, we also identify a 48-kDa interacting protein, which is a possible component of the mammalian selenocysteine insertion (SECIS) pathway. To our knowledge, SECp43 is the first cloned protein demonstrated to associate specifically with eukaryotic tRNA(Sec)."

Past genetic analyses suggest that maternal factors repress the expression of zen in ventral regions, thereby restricting zen products to dorsal and dorsal-lateral regions of precellular embryos. Subsequent interactions with other zygotic D/V regulatory genes refine the zen pattern, restricting expression to the dorsal-most ectoderm. Here we describe the use of zen promoter fusions and P-element transformation to identify cis elements that are responsible for the complex spatial pattern of zen expression. The zen promoter shows a two-tier organization: Distal sequences mediate its initial response to maternal factors, whereas proximal sequences are responsible for the refinement of the pattern in older embryos. The distal regulatory element has the property of a silencer (or anti-enhancer) element and can act over a distance to repress ventral expression of a heterologous promoter. Also, we discuss evidence that proximal promoter sequences interact with factors that may be modulated by a cell-cell communication pathway."

Administration of HspB5 was therapeutic in animal models of multiple sclerosis, retinal and cardiac ischemia, and stroke.

In humans, the thymus exhibits levels of the enzyme up to 100-fold higher than most other tissues. Using transgenic mice, we identified human ADA gene regulatory domains. Up to 3.7 kb of 5'-flanking and first exon DNA from the human ADA gene failed to promote the expression of a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene in an efficient, reproducible, or tissue-appropriate manner in transgenic mice. However, when 12.8 kb of DNA from the first intron of the human ADA gene was placed 3' of CAT-coding and -processing sequences, transgenic mice reproducibly expressed CAT activity in most tissues, with profoundly high levels in the thymus. DNase I hypersensitivity studies demonstrated that among transgenic mouse tissues, human thymus, and a variety of human cell lines, a region of the intron 4-10 kb downstream of the first exon exhibited an array of hypersensitive sites that varied according to tissue and cell type. Deletion of this region from the gene construction eliminated high-level expression in transgenic mice. In transfection-transient expression assays, the 12.8-kb intron fragment exhibited enhancer activity in several cell types. A 1.3-kb fragment encompassing two of the hypersensitive sites exhibited some of these activities. The results of these studies suggest that the diverse pattern of human ADA gene expression is determined, in part, by a cluster of cis-regulatory elements contained within its large first intron."

This requires a fine balance between the constant degradation of damaged mitochondria, biogenesis of new mitochondria, movement along microtubules, dynamic processes, and adequate functional capacity to meet firing demands. The distribution of mitochondria needs to be tightly controlled throughout the entire neuron, including its projections. Axons in particular can be enormous structures compared to the size of the cell soma, and how mitochondria are maintained in these compartments is poorly defined. Mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons is associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases, with the axon being preferentially vulnerable to destruction.

Hershey Medical Center, Pennsylvania State University, Hershey 17033.']","In yeast, galactose triggers a rapid GAL4-dependent induction of galactose/melibiose regulon (GAL/MEL) gene transcription, and glucose represses this activation. We discovered that alterations in the physical state of the GAL4 protein correlate with activation and repression of the GAL/MEL genes. Using Western immunoblot assay, we observe two electrophoretic forms of GAL4 protein-GAL4I and GAL4II-in noninduced cells. In the absence of glucose, the addition of galactose to such cells results in the rapid appearance of a third and slower-migrating form, GAL4III, which differs from at least GAL4I by phosphorylation. GAL80-deletion cells that constitutively transcribe galactose-responsive genes due to the lack of the GAL80 protein, an antagonist of the GAL4 protein, exhibit GAL4III without galactose addition. Addition of glucose, which results in rapid repression of galactose gene transcription, triggers a rapid elimination of GAL4III and an increase in GAL4II. Cycloheximide experiments provide evidence that the galactose- and glucose-triggered GAL4 protein mobility shifts are due to post-translational modification. GAL4III is labeled with [32P]phosphate in vivo; in vivo 35S-labeled GAL4III could be converted by phosphatase treatment in vitro to GAL4I. We present a model proposing that phosphorylation state changes in the GAL4 protein are key to modulating its activity."

Reducing connexin 26 expression by Cre/loxP recombination in the inner ear of adult mice results in a decreased endocochlear potential, increased hearing thresholds, and loss of >90% of outer hair cells, indicating that this connexin is essential for maintenance of cochlear function. In the developing cochlea, connexins are necessary for intercellular calcium signaling activity. Ribbon synapses and basolateral membrane currents fail to mature in inner hair cells of mice that are born with reduced connexin expression, even though hair cells do not express any connexin. In contrast, pannexin 1, an alternative mediator of intercellular signaling, is dispensable for hearing acquisition and auditory function."

Over the past decade, one of the main findings in this field is the characterization of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) as an essential regulator for morphogen gradient formation. Genetic and cell biological studies have showed that HSPGs can regulate morphogen activities at various steps including control of morphogen movement, signaling, and intracellular trafficking. Here, we review these data, highlighting recent findings that reveal mechanistic roles of HSPGs in controlling morphogen gradient formation."

Here, experimental evidence is presented for the existence of metastable structures in the 5' leader of the hok and pnd mRNAs in vitro. The kinetics of refolding from the metastable to the stable structure in the isolated fragments of the 5' ends of both the hok and pnd mRNAs could be estimated, in agreement with the structural rearrangement in this region, as predicted to occur during transcription and mRNA activation. The refolding rates of hok and pnd structures are slow enough to allow for the formation of downstream hairpin structures during elongation of the mRNAs, which thereby helps to stabilize the metastable structures. Thus, the kinetic refolding parameters of the hok and pnd mRNAs are consistent with the proposal that the metastable structures prevent premature translation and/or antisense RNA binding during transcription."

Deletion of the binding site for the protein results in at least a 50-fold decrease in recombination frequency in vivo. By a combination of conventional and recognition site affinity chromatography, we have achieved greater than 20,000-fold purification of the protein from calf thymus, with an overall yield of 22%.

Four YAC clones covering the 1.1-Mb candidate region at the telomere of Xq28 were subjected to direct cDNA selection and Alu long-range PCR. The products of both methods were subsequently used to isolate 154 cosmid clones that were assembled into five cosmid contigs. This first-generation cosmid map covered the region almost entirely and was used as a basis for constructing a transcript map that was in turn integrated with the physical YAC and cosmid maps. To isolate specifically coding sequences, exon trapping and cDNA selection methods were combined. Exon trapping was carried out on YAC Alu-PCR products, YAC Alu long-range PCR products, and on pools of cosmids. The region-specific enriched cDNA library was then screened by using the exon trap products as complex probes. To ensure a more complete analysis, the products from cDNA selection experiments were also used to screen conventional oligo(dT) primed cDNA libraries. Twenty overlapping cDNA contigs were assembled and computer analyses were performed to identify EST hits, open reading frames, protein motifs, and protein sequence homologies. Five of the cDNA contigs corresponded to known sequences such as the factor VIII, c6.1A, and c6.1B. genes, and both distal copies of the factor VIII intron 22 repeat sequence. Expression patterns of the 15 new cDNA contigs were analyzed by Northern blot and RT-PCR studies and these data were integrated with expression data obtained from known EST sequences.

A cellular model for these two phases has emerged from studies of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the three major excitatory synaptic pathways in the hippocampus. One especially effective protocol for inducing robust and persistent LTP is ""theta-burst"" stimulation, which is designed to mimic the firing patterns of hippocampal neurons recorded during exploratory behavior in intact awake animals. Unlike LTP induced by non-theta tetanization regimens, little is known about the biochemical mechanisms underlying theta-burst LTP in the hippocampus. In the present study, we examined theta-burst LTP in the Schaffer collateral pathway. We found that 3 sec of theta-burst stimulation induced a robust and persistent potentiation (theta L-LTP) in mouse hippocampal slices. This theta L-LTP was dependent on NMDA receptor activation. The initial or early phase of theta-LTP did not require either protein or RNA synthesis and was independent of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activation. In contrast, the late phase of theta-LTP required synthesis of proteins and RNA and was blocked by inhibitors of PKA. Prior induction of theta-LTP also occluded the potentiation elicited by chemical activation of PKA. Our results show that, like non-theta LTP, theta-induced LTP in area CA1 of the mouse hippocampus also involves transcription, translation, and PKA and suggest that cAMP-mediated gene transcription may be a common mechanism responsible for the late phases of LTP induced by both theta and non-theta patterns of stimulation."

The dimerization initiation site (DIS) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA is a hairpin structure that contains in the loop a 6-nt self-complementary sequence flanked by two 5' and one 3' purines. The self-complementary sequence, as well as the flanking purines, are crucial for dimerization of HIV-1 RNA, which is mediated by formation of a ""kissing-loop"" complex between the DIS of each monomer. Here, we used chemical modification interference, lead-induced cleavage, and three-dimensional modeling to compare dimerization of subtype A and B HIV-1 RNAs. The DIS loop sequences of these RNAs are AGGUGCACA and AAGCGCGCA, respectively. In both RNAs, ethylation of most but not all phosphate groups in the loop and methylation of the N7 position of the G residues in the self-complementary sequence inhibited dimerization. These results demonstrate that small perturbations of the loop structure are detrimental to dimerization. Conversely, methylation of the N1 position of the first and last As in the loop were neutral or enhanced dimerization, a result consistent with these residues forming a noncanonical sheared base pair. Phosphorothioate interference, lead-induced cleavage, and Brownian-dynamics simulation revealed an unexpected difference in the dimerization mechanism of these RNAs. Unlike subtype B, subtype A requires binding of a divalent cation in the loop to promote RNA dimerization. This difference should be taken into consideration in the design of antidimerization molecules aimed at inhibiting HIV-1 replication."

We suggest that in mab-9 males the identities of B and F are transformed into Y and U, their respective anterior neighbors. The case for the F-to-U transformation is less strong than for the B-to-Y transformation because the wild-type lineages of F and U are very similar. Some mab-9 hermaphrodites are constipated as a result of abnormal rectal structure. This may be the result of an analogous fate transformation. mab-9 worms of both sexes are slightly uncoordinated. We propose that the fates of the four rectal cells are initially specified as two pairs (B and Y, F and U) and that the function of mab-9 in both sexes is to differentiate the posterior member of each pair from its anterior neighbor."

Diapause is a unique dormant state that suspends embryonic development without tradeoffs in the adulthood life span. Recently, diapause has been gaining increasing interest from the research community. Here, we report our methods for handling the embryos of N. furzeri that go through diapause. We focus on a few key steps: (1) collecting N. furzeri embryos, (2) sorting embryos entering diapause, (3) storing diapause embryos, (4) screening embryos exiting diapause, and (5) hatching post-diapause and fully developed embryos. This method should help the need to obtain a large number of embryos in synchronization with their diapause-entering and -exiting status and satisfy the need for cell biology, genetic, genomic, and biochemistry experiments."
"Acquisition of a new-latency conditioned nictitating membrane response--major, but not complete, dependence on the ipsilateral cerebellum.",Learning & Memory,Learn.

In several two-stage experiments, reversible inactivations of the deep cerebellar nuclei in stage 1 appeared to prevent acquisition of NMR conditioning in naive rabbits--no conditioned responses (CRs) were evident after inactivations were lifted in stage 2. Results of a three-stage experiment were different. When subjects were first trained with a light conditional stimulus (CS) in stage 1, reversible cerebellar inactivations during conditioning to a different, tone CS during stage 2 did not appear to prevent new learning because CRs to the tone CS were evident when the inactivation was lifted. Results from the two-stage experiments support the suggestion that the cerebellum is essential for the acquisition of NMR conditioning, but results from the three-stage experiment do not. Here, we use a three-stage design with different interstimulus intervals (ISIs) in stages 1 and 2. Because CRs develop with latencies-to-peak dependent on the ISI, learning during stage 1 can be dissociated from that accruing in stage 2. Complete inactivation of the ipsilateral cerebellar nuclei with muscimol substantially but not completely prevented learning with the second ISI during stage 2 because small CR peaks around the stage 2 ISI could be detected in some subjects after the inactivation had been lifted in stage 3. We suggest that the weak levels of conditioning possible during unilateral inactivation depend on the contralateral cerebellum or on extracerebellar circuitry and that these may be capable of supporting transfer of conditioning in a previous three-stage experiment. But, we confirm that normal NMR conditioning is critically dependent on the ipsilateral cerebellum."

Multiple viral genotypes in the Orthohepevirus A species are able to replicate and cause acute hepatitis E in humans, and thus represent an important public health problem in industrialized as well as developing countries. Although hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections typically result in acute and self-limited hepatitis, immunocompromised and transplant patients are vulnerable to prolonged infections and to chronic hepatitis. Cell culture systems have been established for several HEV strains and offer new opportunities for the study of HEV biology. Similarly, a variety of new small animal models have been developed, using either nonhuman hepeviruses in their cognate hosts as surrogates for human HEV, or human HEV infection of immunodeficient mice with chimeric livers engrafted with human hepatocytes. These new models provide several advantages over previous nonhuman primate models of hepatitis E infection and will facilitate studies of pathogenicity, cross-species infection, mechanisms of virus replication, and vaccine and antiviral agent development.

Structure/function studies on the human proteins have identified motifs in the N-terminal RRM that are critical for RNA-binding specificity but have failed to identify a function for the C-terminal RRM. Interestingly, SNF is chimeric in these motifs, suggesting a basis for its dual specificity. Here, we test the importance of these motifs by introducing site-directed mutations in the snf coding region and examining the effects of these mutations on assembly into the snRNP and on snf function in vivo. We found that an N-terminal RRM mutant protein predicted to eliminate RNA binding still assembles into snRNPs and is capable of rescuing snf's lethal phenotype only if the normally dispensable C-terminal RRM is present. We also found that the mixed motif in the ""RNA-specificity"" domain is necessary for SNF's dual function whereas the mixed motif in the U2A'-protein-binding region is not. Finally, we demonstrate that animals carrying a snf mutation that converts SNF from a bifunctional protein to a U1 snRNP-specific protein are viable. This unexpected result suggests that SNF's presence within the U2 snRNP is not essential for splicing."

The resulting change in the cell length, observed by microscopy, has been termed “electromotility.” The mechanism of force generation OHCs can be traced to a specific protein, prestin, a member of a superfamily SLC26 of transporters. This short review will identify some of the more recent findings on prestin. Although the tertiary structure of prestin has yet to be determined, results from the presence of its homologs in nonmammalian species suggest a possible conformation in mammalian OHCs, how it can act like a transport protein, and how it may have evolved."

The activation of SOS involves membrane recruitment and conformational changes, triggered by lipid binding, that open the allosteric binding site for Ras•GTP. This is in contrast to other Ras-specific GEFs, which are activated by second messengers that more directly affect the active site.

Long double-stranded (ds)RNA is a common viral by-product originating during RNA virus replication and is universally sensed as a danger signal to trigger the antiviral response. As a result, viruses hide dsRNA intermediates into viral replication factories and have evolved strategies to hijack cellular proteins for their benefit. The characterization of the host factors associated with viral dsRNA and involved in viral replication remains a major challenge to develop new antiviral drugs against RNA viruses. Here, we performed anti-dsRNA immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry analysis to fully characterize the dsRNA interactome in Sindbis virus (SINV) infected human cells. Among the identified proteins, we characterized SFPQ (splicing factor, proline-glutamine rich) as a new dsRNA-associated proviral factor upon SINV infection. We showed that SFPQ depletion reduces SINV infection in human HCT116 and SK-N-BE(2) cells, suggesting that SFPQ enhances viral production. We demonstrated that the cytoplasmic fraction of SFPQ partially colocalizes with dsRNA upon SINV infection. In agreement, we proved by RNA-IP that SFPQ can bind dsRNA and viral RNA. Furthermore, we showed that overexpression of a wild-type, but not an RNA binding mutant SFPQ, increased viral infection, suggesting that RNA binding is essential for its positive effect on the virus. Overall, this study provides the community with a compendium of dsRNA-associated factors during viral infection and identifies SFPQ as a new proviral dsRNA binding protein."

A large body of experimental observations has shown that yeast cells are able to break symmetry and establish polarity through two coupled and partially redundant intrinsic mechanisms, even in the absence of any pre-existing external asymmetry. One of these mechanisms is dependent upon interplay between the actin cytoskeleton and the Rho family GTPase Cdc42, whereas the other relies on a Cdc42 GTPase signaling network. Integral to these mechanisms appear to be positive feedback loops capable of amplifying small and stochastic asymmetries. Spatial cues, such as bud scars and pheromone gradients, orient cell polarity by modulating the regulation of the Cdc42 GTPase cycle, thereby biasing the site of asymmetry amplification."

The expression of Elf-1 during embryogenesis is restricted to nuclei of tissues derived from ectoderm, predominantly the central nervous system (CNS) and the epidermis. Within the CNS, Elf-1 is present in only a small fraction of nuclei, and the pattern of expressing nuclei changes dramatically during development. Elf-1 and Ddc are coexpressed in primary cultures of neural cells. However, we do not detect Elf-1 in Ddc-expressing neurons in vivo, leading to the suggestion that Elf-1 activity is required in vivo for initiation of Ddc expression but not for its maintenance. The antibodies also were used to isolate cDNA clones encoding Elf-1. Alternate forms of Elf-1 mRNA result in at least three protein isoforms."

The purified protein consists of several polypeptides that bind selectively to a functionally important cis-control element of the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) promoter and to the neurogenic elements of both the dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) and fushi tarazu (ftz) promoter/enhancer regions. Purified NTF-1 activates transcription in vitro in a binding site-dependent manner through upstream sequences of the Ubx promoter. A cDNA clone encoding the open reading frame of NTF-1 was isolated, and the deduced primary amino acid sequence of NTF-1 includes a glutamine-rich region reminiscent of the transcriptional activation domains found in Sp1 but no recognizable DNA-binding domain. NTF-1 expression is temporally regulated during embryonic development. In addition, in situ hybridization experiments revealed that NTF-1 is transcribed in a spatially restricted pattern in the embryo, with the highest level of expression observed in the epidermis and a subset of cells in the CNS. Expression of the NTF-1 cDNA in mammalian cells yields a protein that displays DNA-binding and transcriptional activities indistinguishable from that of the collection of proteins isolated from Drosophila embryos. These findings suggest that NTF-1 is a member of a family of developmentally regulated transcription factors that may be involved in directing the expression of genes such as Ubx, Ddc, and ftz in neuronal cells."

The phosphorylation reaction proceeds by a mechanism shared with the Ntr and Che kinases, NRII, and CheA. EnvZ can phosphorylate NRI and can stimulate transcription from the glnAp2 promoter, and similarly, CheA can phosphorylate OmpR and can stimulate transcription from the ompF promoter. OmpR-P formed by either CheA or EnvZ is much more stable than CheY-P and NRI-P, but is rapidly hydrolyzed to OmpR and Pi by EnvZ in the presence of ATP, ADP, or nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP. Because EnvZ is normally a transmembrane receptor with a periplasmic sensory domain, our results suggest that the role of EnvZ may be to control the intracellular concentration of OmpR-P in response to environmental signals."

IM has previously been linked to activating somatic and germline point mutations in the PDGFRβ tyrosine kinase encoded by the PDGFRB gene. Clinical panel-based targeted tumor sequencing of a tumor from a newborn with multifocal IM revealed a novel PDGFRB rearrangement, which was reported as being of unclear significance. Additional sequencing of cDNA from tumor and germline DNA confirmed a complex somatic/mosaic PDGFRB rearrangement with an apparent partial tandem duplication disrupting the juxtamembrane domain. Ectopic expression of cDNA encoding the mutant form of PDGFRB markedly enhanced cell proliferation of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to wild-type PDGFRB and conferred tumor-forming capacity on nontumorigenic 10T1/2 fibroblasts. The mutated protein enhanced MAPK activation and retained sensitivity to the PDGFRβ inhibitor imatinib.

Over the past two decades, dozens of papers have presented contradictory data on eIF4G2 function. Since its identification, eIF4G2 has been assumed to participate in noncanonical translation initiation mechanisms, but recent results indicate that it can be involved in scanning as well. In particular, eIF4G2 provides leaky scanning through some upstream open reading frames (uORFs), which are typical for long 5′ UTRs of mRNAs from higher eukaryotes. It is likely the protein can also help the ribosome overcome other impediments during scanning of the 5′ UTRs of animal mRNAs. This may explain the need for eIF4G2 in higher eukaryotes, as many mRNAs that encode regulatory proteins have rather long and highly structured 5′ UTRs. Additionally, they often bind to various proteins, which also hamper the movement of scanning ribosomes. This review discusses the suggested mechanisms of eIF4G2 action, denotes obscure or inconsistent results, and proposes ways to uncover other fundamental mechanisms in which this important protein factor may be involved in higher eukaryotes."

Inducible NF-κB activation depends on phosphorylation-induced proteosomal degradation of the inhibitor of NF-κB proteins (IκBs), which retain inactive NF-κB dimers in the cytosol in unstimulated cells. The majority of the diverse signaling pathways that lead to NF-κB activation converge on the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which is responsible for IκB phosphorylation and is essential for signal transduction to NF-κB. Additional regulation of NF-κB activity is achieved through various post-translational modifications of the core components of the NF-κB signaling pathways. In addition to cytosolic modifications of IKK and IκB proteins, as well as other pathway-specific mediators, the transcription factors are themselves extensively modified. Tremendous progress has been made over the last two decades in unraveling the elaborate regulatory networks that control the NF-κB response. This has made the NF-κB pathway a paradigm for understanding general principles of signal transduction and gene regulation."

We examined how resting-state functional connectivity within the hippocampal–striatal–cortical network differs after offline consolidation intervals of sleep, nap, or wake. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired immediately before and after training on a procedural problem-solving task that requires the acquisition of a novel cognitive strategy and immediately prior to the retest period (i.e., following the consolidation interval). ROI to ROI and seed to whole-brain functional connectivity analyses both specifically and consistently demonstrated strengthened hippocampal–prefrontal functional connectivity following a period of sleep versus wake. These results were associated with task-related gains in behavioral performance. Changes in functional communication were also observed between groups using the striatum as a seed.

Sequence analysis of the FMR1 protein has suggested that RNA binding is related to the presence of two K-homologous (KH) modules and an RGG box. However, no attempt has been so far made to map the RNA-binding sites along the protein sequence and to identify possible differential RNA-sequence specificity. In the present article, we describe work done to dissect FMR1 into regions with structurally and functionally distinct properties. A semirational approach was followed to identify four regions: an N-terminal stretch of 200 amino acids, the two KH regions, and a C-terminal stretch. Each region was produced as a recombinant protein, purified, and probed for its state of folding by spectroscopical techniques. Circular dichroism and NMR spectra of the N-terminus show formation of secondary structure with a strong tendency to aggregate. Of the two homologous KH motifs, only the first one is folded whereas the second remains unfolded even when it is extended both N- and C-terminally. The C-terminus is, as expected from its amino acid composition, nonglobular. Binding assays were then performed using the 4-nt homopolymers. Our results show that only the first KH domain but not the second binds to RNA, and provide the first direct evidence for RNA binding of both the N-terminal and the C-terminal regions. RNA binding for the N-terminus could not be predicted from sequence analysis because no known RNA-binding motif is identifiable in this region. Different sequence specificity was observed for the fragments: both the N-terminus of the protein and KH1 bind preferentially to poly-(rG). The C-terminal region, which contains the RGG box, is nonspecific, as it recognizes the bases with comparable affinity. We therefore conclude that FMR1 is a protein with multiple sites of interaction with RNA: sequence specificity is most likely achieved by the whole block that comprises the first approximately 400 residues, whereas the C-terminus provides a nonspecific binding surface."

In this article we will highlight the key genetic studies that uncovered the role of cadherin–catenin proteins in vertebrate development and discuss the potential role of these proteins as molecular biosensors of external cellular microenvironment that may spatially confine signaling molecules and polarity cues to orchestrate cellular behavior throughout the complex process of normal morphogenesis."

The platform leverages the core of the sciATAC workflow where multiple indexed tagmentation reactions are performed, followed by pooling and distribution to a second set of reaction wells for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based indexing. In this work, we instead leverage a chip containing 5184 nanowells at the PCR stage of indexing, enabling a 52-fold improvement in scale and reduction in per-cell preparation costs. We detail three variants that balance cell throughput and depth of coverage, and apply these methods to banked mouse brain tissue, producing maps of cell types as well as neuronal subtypes that include integration with existing single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (scATAC) and scRNA-seq data sets. Our optimized workflow achieves a high fraction of reads that fall within called peaks (>80%) and low cell doublet rates. The high cell coverage technique produces high unique reads per cell, while retaining high enrichment for open chromatin regions, enabling the assessment of >70,000 unique accessible loci on average for each cell profiled. When compared to current methods in the field, our technique provides similar or superior per-cell information with very low levels of cell-to-cell cross talk, and achieves this at a cost point much lower than existing assays."

After stirring the suspension for 30 min to allow extraction of transcription factors, the nuclei are centrifuged again, and the resulting supernatant or extract is dialyzed for use in transcription experiments. Generally, 1 L of culture (i.e., 1-2 g of cells, depending on cell density at harvest) yields 1-2 mL of extract at 6-10 mg/mL.

Smale'],,"The nuclear run-on assay was developed as a method for establishing that the transcription initiation rate contributes to the regulated expression of mammalian genes. The difference between monitoring gene expression by the nuclear run-on assay versus most other assays is that the nuclear run-on assay provides a measure of the frequency of transcription initiation and is largely independent of the effects of RNA stability. It can also be used to determine whether polymerase pausing or attenuation contributes to gene regulation. Briefly, the nuclear run-on assay begins with samples of cells that contain different steady-state amounts of the mRNA or protein of interest. The cells are chilled, and the plasmid membranes are permeabilized or lysed. These steps result in polymerase pausing. The nuclei are then incubated for a short time at 37°C in the presence of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) and radiolabeled uridine 5′-triphosphate (UTP). New transcripts are not initiated during this incubation, but the radiolabeled nucleotide becomes incorporated into transcripts that were being synthesized when the cells were first chilled and lysed. The number of nascent transcripts on the gene at the time of chilling is thought to be proportional to the frequency of transcription initiation. To determine the relative number of nascent transcripts in each sample, the radiolabeled RNA is purified and hybridized to a membrane containing immobilized DNA from the gene of interest. The amount of radioactivity that hybridizes to the membrane is approximately proportional to the number of nascent transcripts."

We show that mP1 sequences 5' to the start of transcription are sufficient to confer spermatid-specific expression on the hGH gene. We also show that 156 nucleotides of mP1 3'-untranslated sequence is sufficient to confer mP1-like translational regulation on the hGH mRNA. Interestingly, the subcellular localization of hGH was dependent on the time during spermiogenesis that it was made. Synthesis of hGH in early round spermatids resulted in localization in the acrosome, whereas synthesis in late elongating spermatids resulted in intracellular, but not acrosomal, localization."

A major clinical hurdle in patient management and treatment is that when using current surveillance technologies 80% of patients will be clinically diagnosed as having had a complete clinical response to primary therapy. In fact, the majority of women nonetheless develop disease recurrence within 18 mo. Thus, without more accurate surveillance protocols, the diagnostic question regarding OvCa recurrence remains framed as “when” rather than “if.” With this background, we describe the case of a 61-yr-old female who presented with a 3-mo history of unexplained whole-body rash, which unexpectedly led to a diagnosis of and her treatment for OvCa. The rash resolved immediately following debulking surgery. Nearly 1 yr later, however, the rash reappeared, prompting the prospect of tumor recurrence and requirement for additional chemotherapy. To investigate this possibility, we undertook a genomics-based tumor surveillance approach using a targeted 56-gene NGS panel and biobanked tumor samples to develop personalized ctDNA biomarkers. Although tumor-specific TP53 and PTEN mutations were detectable in all originally collected tumor samples, pelvic washes, and blood samples, they were not detectable in any biosample collected beyond the first month of treatment. No additional chemotherapy was given. The rash spontaneously resolved. Now, 2 yr beyond the patient's original surgery, and in the face of continued negative ctDNA findings, the patient remains with no evidence of disease. As this single case report suggests, we believe for the first time that ctDNA can provide an additional layer of information to avoid overtreatment."

Resulting gradients can be translated into patterns of stable gene activities using genes whose products have a positive feedback on the activation on themselves. If several autoregulatory genes compete with each other for activity, cells make an unequivocal choice. Although the signal consists of a smoothly graded distribution, the all-or-nothing response of the cells leads to regions of differently determined cells that are delimited by sharp borders. In some systems, it is not the absolute but the relative level of a gradient that matters. The sequence of head, tentacles, and foot formation in hydra is controlled by a head activation gradient and is an example of this widely used but conceptually rather neglected mode. For subpatterns such as legs and wings, different “compartments” cooperate to produce new signaling substances. Here, morphogen production is restricted to the common borders or where they intersect. The model accounts for the formation of substructures in pairs at the correct positions within the embryo and for the correct orientation and handedness with respect to the main body axes."

Examination of mitosis in brain neuroblasts revealed that 30 of these lethals cause disruptions in mitotic chromosome behavior. These mutants identify genes whose wild-type functions are important for: (1) progression through different steps of interphase, (2) the maintenance of mitotic chromosome integrity, (3) chromosome condensation, (4) spindle formation and/or function, and (5) completion of cytokinesis or completion of chromosome segregation. The presence of mitotic defects in late lethal mutants is correlated tightly with the presence of defective imaginal discs. Thus, the phenotypes of late lethality and poorly developed imaginal discs are together almost diagnostic of mutations in essential cell-cycle functions. The terminal phenotypes exhibited by these Drosophila mitotic mutants are remarkably similar to those observed in mammalian cell-cycle mutants, suggesting that these diverse organisms use a common genetic logic to regulate and integrate the events of the cell cycle."

Previous anatomical, physiological, and behavioral research suggests that auditory-conditioned stimulus information is routed to the cerebellum by the pontine nuclei. However, it has also been observed from multiple unit recordings that some populations of pontine cells, in addition to showing auditory-evoked responses, also show changes in activity that is learning-related. It is unknown whether this learning-related activity is generated by the pontine cells or whether it is generated by some other structure and projected to the pontine nuclei. Because the cerebellum has been implicated in the formation of the essential plasticity that subserves this learned behavior, we examined how multiple unit recordings of learning-related activity within the pontine nuclei are affected by reversible inactivation of the interpositus nucleus of the cerebellum. The results indicated clearly that when the interpositus nucleus was inactivated, the learning-related activity in the pontine nuclei was abolished completely and the auditory stimulus-evoked activity was unaffected. In contract, when the facial nucleus was inactivated, both the auditory stimulus and the learning-related activity were still present. These results indicate that the learning-related activity exhibited by some populations of pontine nuclei cells is dependent on the interpositus nucleus and may represent feedback from the cerebellum."

Multiple stress-associated conditions including pH acidosis, oxidation, and unusual availability of metal ions, as well as reversible stress-induced phosphorylation can modulate sHSP chaperone activity. Investigations of sHSPs reveal that sHSPs can engage in transient or long-lived interactions with client proteins depending on solution conditions and sHSP or client identity.

Patients 1 and 2 (P1, P2), both male, were diagnosed at 27 and 37 yr of age, respectively, with shoulder (P1) and inguinal (P2) soft tissue tumors. Both patients developed metastatic disease, and P2 died of disease. P1 tumor showed a rhabdoid cytomorphology and a complete loss of INI1 (SMARCB1) expression, associated with a homozygous SMARCB1 deletion. The tumor from P2 showed a clear cell/small cell morphology, retained INI1 expression and strong S100 positivity. By WES and WGS, tumors from both patients displayed low tumor mutation burdens, and no targetable alterations in cancer genes were detected. P2's tumor harbored an EWSR1::KLF15 rearrangement, whereas the tumor from P1 showed a novel ASCC2::GGNBP2 fusion. WGS evidenced a complex genomic event involving mainly Chromosomes 17 and 22 in the tumor from P1, which was consistent with chromoplexy. These findings are consistent with previous reports of EWSR1 rearrangements (50% of cases) in MECs and provide a genetic basis for the loss of SMARCB1 protein expression observed through immunohistochemistry in 10% of 40% of MEC cases. The lack of additional driver mutations in these tumors supports the hypothesis that these alterations are the key molecular events in MEC evolution. Furthermore, the presence of complex structural variant patterns, invisible to WES, highlights the novel biological insights that can be gained through the application of WGS to rare cancers."

We describe a pediatric patient with a HIST1H3B K36I-mutant histiocytic tumor arising in the skull.

Regulated expression at high copy number allows production of a growth-inhibitory oncogene product in Drosophila Schneider cells.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.6.882,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/6/882,3,6,06/01/1989,882,889,"['H Johansen', 'A van der Straten', 'R Sweet', 'E Otto', 'G Maroni', 'M Rosenberg']","['Smith Kline & French Laboratories, Research and Development Division, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.']","The Drosophila metallothionein promoter (Mtn) was used to obtain efficient, regulated expression of foreign gene products inserted in high copy numbers into Drosophila melanogaster Schneider 2 cells. An expression unit comprised of a reporter gene [Escherichia coli galactokinase (galK)] fused to the Mtn promoter was stably introduced into Schneider 2 cells in up to several hundred copies per cell in a single transfection-selection event. This system contrasts dramatically with other eukaryotic systems that permit only a few copies of a gene to be stably inserted in a single transfection-selection event. The transfected Drosophila S2 cell lines expressed high levels of both galK mRNA and protein in response to metal induction. Most important, and in contrast to mammalian cells, expression remained fully regulated even at high copy number, with low basal expression maintained in the absence of inducer. This regulated system was used to obtain efficient expression in Drosophila cells of an otherwise lethal or growth-inhibitory gene product, the human H-ras oncogene. The ability to obtain regulated high-level expression of potentially lethal foreign proteins is unique to the Drosophila cell system."

Activation of PKC occurred during the training stimulus and persisted for at least 2 hr thereafter but was not maintained for 24 hr. The persistent activation required protein synthesis and was blocked by cyproheptidine, an agent that also blocked the initial activation of PKC. Persistent activation involved both an increase in membrane-associated Apl I and an increase in an autonomous kinase activity that may be related to a post-translational modification of Apl II. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that in addition to its role in producing the presynaptic facilitation of mechanosensory-motor neuron synapses that underlie short-term facilitation, PKC is needed for maintaining synaptic changes in an intermediate period that precedes the modifications accompanying consolidation of memory."

PTEN gene deletion or loss-of-function mutations favor tumor cell growth and are commonly found in clinical practice. In addition, diminished PTEN protein expression is also frequently observed in tumor samples from cancer patients in the absence of PTEN gene alterations. This makes PTEN protein levels a potential biomarker parameter in clinical oncology, which can guide therapeutic decisions. The specific detection of PTEN protein can be achieved by using highly defined anti-PTEN monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), characterized with precision in terms of sensitivity for the detection technique, specificity for PTEN binding, and constraints of epitope recognition. This is especially relevant taking into consideration that PTEN is highly targeted by mutations and posttranslational modifications, and different PTEN protein isoforms exist. The precise characterization of anti-PTEN mAb reactivity is an important step in the validation of these reagents as diagnostic and prognostic tools in clinical oncology, including their routine use in analytical immunohistochemistry (IHC). Here, we review the current status on the use of well-defined anti-PTEN mAbs for PTEN immunodetection in the clinical context and discuss their potential usefulness and limitations for a more precise cancer diagnosis and patient benefit."

It is the most potent, often efficacious at low nanomolar concentrations, and its receptors undergo dramatic desensitization. Recent studies have identified a new class of calcium-release channel, the two-pore channels (TPCs), as the likely targets for NAADP regulation, even though the effect may be indirect. These channels localized at endolysosomes, where they mediate local Ca 2+ release, and have highlighted a new role of acidic organelles as targets for messenger-evoked Ca 2+ mobilization. Three distinct roles of TPCs have been identified. The first is to effect local Ca 2+ release that may play a role in endolysosomal function including vesicular fusion and trafficking. The second is to trigger global calcium release by recruiting Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ -release (CICR) channels at lysosomal–endoplasmic reticulum (ER) junctions. The third is to regulate plasma membrane excitability by the targeting of Ca 2+ release from appropriately positioned subplasma membrane stores to regulate plasma membrane Ca 2+ -activated channels. In this review, I discuss the role of nicotinic acid adenine nucleotide diphosphate (NAADP)-mediated Ca 2+ release from endolysosomal stores as a widespread trigger for intracellular calcium signaling mechanisms, and how studies of TPCs are beginning to enhance our understanding of the central role of lysosomes in Ca 2+ signaling."

Morgan School of Biological Sciences and the Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington 40506-0225, USA.']","Mutants in the Drosophila crooked neck (crn) gene show an embryonic lethal phenotype with severe developmental defects. The unusual crn protein consists of sixteen tandem repeats of the 34 amino acid tetratricopeptide (TPR) protein recognition domain. Crn-like TPR elements are found in several RNA processing proteins, although it is unknown how the TPR repeats or the crn protein contribute to Drosophila development. We have isolated a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, CLF1, that encodes a crooked neck-like factor. CLF1 is an essential gene but the lethal phenotype of a clf1::HIS3 chromosomal null mutant can be rescued by plasmid-based expression of CLF1 or the Drosophila crn open reading frame. Clf1p is required in vivo and in vitro for pre-mRNA 5' splice site cleavage. Extracts depleted of Clf1p arrest spliceosome assembly after U2 snRNP addition but prior to productive U4/U6.U5 association. Yeast two-hybrid analyses and in vitro binding studies show that Clf1p interacts specifically and differentially with the U1 snRNP-Prp40p protein and the yeast U2AF65 homolog, Mud2p. Intriguingly, Prp40p and Mud2p also bind the phylogenetically conserved branchpoint binding protein (BBP/SF1). Our results indicate that Clf1p acts as a scaffolding protein in spliceosome assembly and suggest that Clf1p may support the cross-intron bridge during the prespliceosome-to-spliceosome transition."

Here, we describe two individuals with connective tissue nevi (CTNs) and some general attributes of Proteus syndrome who were found to have mosaic PIK3CA variants. CTNs on the soles of individuals with PIK3CA -related overgrowth typically exhibit thickening of the soft tissues with at most a wrinkled surface, but these two patients had firm plaques with ridges and furrows characteristic of CCTNs, which was histologically confirmed in one. These data show that CCTNs are not specific to Proteus syndrome and that clinicians should be cautious in diagnosing individuals with Proteus syndrome based on the CCTN alone. Rather, a complete evaluation should include careful assessment of other attributes of the diagnostic criteria and, whenever possible, genetic analysis of affected tissue."

Newly synthesized Nrf1 is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it is N -glycosylated. N -glycosylated Nrf1 is trafficked to the cytosol by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery and is subject to rapid proteasomal degradation. When proteasome function is impaired, Nrf1 escapes degradation and undergoes proteolytic cleavage and deglycosylation. Deglycosylation results in deamidation of N -glycosylated asparagine residues to edit the protein sequence encoded by the genome. This truncated and “sequence-edited” form of Nrf1 enters the nucleus where it induces up-regulation of proteasome subunit genes. Thus, Nrf1 drives compensatory proteasome biogenesis in cells exposed to proteasome inhibitor drugs and other proteotoxic insults. In addition to its role in proteasome homeostasis, Nrf1 is implicated in responses to oxidative stress, and maintaining lipid and cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we describe the conserved and complex mechanism by which Nrf1 is regulated and highlight emerging evidence linking this unusual transcription factor to development, aging, and disease."

Previous studies with nonselective NO synthase inhibitors have produced contradictory results in learning experiments. However, these drugs also produced blood pressure changes, as NO is an endothelial-derived relaxing factor. A novel NO synthase inhibitor, 7-nitro indazole (7-NI), as a dose (30 mg/kg i.p.) shown previously to inhibit neuronal NO synthase by 85% without affecting blood pressure, produced amnesic effects both in a water maze and in an 8-arm radial maze. Latency as well as distance was greater in the 7-NI group in the water maze while swim speed was not affected. Latency, working memory (WM), and reference memory (RF) errors were also higher in the 7-NI group in the 8-arm maze. At the end of the second training day, these differences were no longer apparent. However, on the fourth training day, a transfer test in the water maze showed that 7-NI had produced a spatial memory deficit, reducing quadrant bias and the number of annulus crossings. Learning of a visual cue task was not affected. No difference between groups was visible in an open field test. We conclude that neuronal NO synthase activity plays a role in learning and memory formation in the rat."

Compounds were applied intracerebroventricularly at different times, either 30 min prior to training or immediately after training, and rats were tested for retention 24 hr later in the same paradigms. Both MCPG and tADA caused amnesia in the spatial alternation test, when applied pretraining, but no effect was obtained in the brightness discrimination paradigm. Drug-induced amnesia was shown not to be attributable to state-dependent effects of MCPG or tADA. Moreover, the memory inhibiting effect of MCPG was dose dependent, with a low dose (20 mM/5 ml) having no effect on learning and memory and a 10 times higher concentration (200 mM/5 ml) causing complete amnesia. Application of both saline and MCPG immediately post-training prevented memory formation, which may be attributable to an interference by the injection procedure with the process of memory formation. The mGluR agonist tADA, however, facilitated memory formation in the spatial alternation task, when injected immediately after training. Post-training application of the compounds had no effect on retention in the brightness discrimination task. On the basis of these data we conclude that (1) mGluRs are of particular importance for spatial learning and play no role in visual discrimination; (2) both the block and the activation of mGluRs inhibit spatial learning, suggesting that saturated activation prevents further modulation of mGluRs, which may be required during learning or memory formation; and (3) mGluR agonist tADA may be memory facilitating when applied after training, thus enhancing the establishment of the memory trace."

Genetic analysis of the role of human U1 snRNA in mRNA splicing: I.

We have now begun a second-site reversion analysis of this suppressor U1-4u snRNA (which has a C----U change at position 4) to identify U1 nucleotides that are essential for mRNA splicing. Point mutations in U1-4u that disrupt the structure of stem-loop I or alter phylogenetically conserved nucleotides within the loop cause loss of suppression. The level of suppressor activity observed for most mutants correlated with the abundance of the corresponding suppressor RNA, suggesting that mutations in stem-loop I cause loss of suppression by destabilizing U1 snRNA or the U1 snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle). We favor the interpretation that incompletely or improperly assembled U1 snRNPs are unstable, because two severe point mutations in stem-loop I were found to decrease the binding of U1 snRNP-specific proteins in vitro. In a separate set of experiments, we found that increasing the distance between stem-loop I and the 5' end of U1 snRNA also inhibited suppression but did not affect assembly or stability of the U1 snRNP. This suggests that the relationship between the 5' splice site and the body of the U1 snRNP is important for mRNA splicing."

Gel electrophoresis of these DNA fragments individually complexed to a repressor shows that the Gal repressor bends both of the gal operators, OE and OI. Similarly, the Lac repressor induces a bend to a lac operator DNA. In each case, the center of the average bent segment is located at or close to the dyad symmetry axis of the operator sequence.

Adenosine is converted to inosine in mRNAs, and this base is interpreted as guanosine during translation. Realizing the potential of this activity for therapeutics, a number of researchers have developed systems that redirect ADAR activity to new targets, ones that are not normally edited. These site-directed RNA editing (SDRE) systems can be broadly classified into two categories: ones that deliver an antisense RNA oligonucleotide to bind opposite a target adenosine, creating an editable structure that endogenously expressed ADARs recognize, and ones that tether the catalytic domain of recombinant ADAR to an antisense RNA oligonucleotide that serves as a targeting mechanism, much like with CRISPR-Cas or RNAi. To date, SDRE has been used mostly to try and correct genetic mutations. Here we argue that these applications are not ideal SDRE, mostly because RNA edits are transient and genetic mutations are not. Instead, we suggest that SDRE could be used to tune cell physiology to achieve temporary outcomes that are therapeutically advantageous, particularly in the nervous system. These include manipulating excitability in nociceptive neural circuits, abolishing specific phosphorylation events to reduce protein aggregation related to neurodegeneration or reduce the glial scarring that inhibits nerve regeneration, or enhancing G protein-coupled receptor signaling to increase nerve proliferation for the treatment of sensory disorders like blindness and deafness."

We applied this technique to study the selection dynamics of a recently reported SELEX to neutrophil elastase. We found that the number of sequences decreased from 10(7) in round 6 to approximately 60 by round 15, the final round. The intermediate rounds are a mixture of a high abundance/low complexity pool with a low abundance/high complexity pool. As the SELEX progresses, the former pool expands at the expense of the latter. This technique should be useful for studying and optimizing SELEX dynamics, as well as for monitoring the progress of SELEX experiments."

The leftward movement of fluid at the ventral node, called nodal flow, is the central process in symmetry breaking on the left–right axis. Nodal flow is autonomously generated by the rotation of posteriorly tilted cilia that are built by transport via KIF3 motor on cells of the ventral node. How nodal flow is interpreted to create left–right asymmetry has been a matter of debate. Recent evidence suggests that the leftward movement of sheathed lipidic particles, called nodal vesicular parcels (NVPs), may result in the activation of the noncanonical hedgehog signaling pathway, an asymmetric elevation in intracellular Ca 2+ and changes in gene expression."

We show here that the responses to olfactory cues are regulated in a dynamic way by behavioral context and the animal's previous experience. Prolonged exposure to an odorant leads to a decreased response to that odorant, a form of behavioral plasticity called olfactory adaptation. We show that starvation can increase the extent of olfactory adaptation to the odorant benzaldehyde; this effect of starvation persists for several hours after the animals have been returned to food. The effect of starvation is antagonized by exogenous serotonin, which induces many of the same behavioral responses in C. elegans as are induced by food. Starvation also inhibits recovery from adaptation to a different odorant, 2-methylpyrazine, thus enhancing olfactory memory. In addition to its effects on adaptation, starvation modulates olfactory discrimination in C. elegans; starved animals discriminate more classes of odorants than fed animals. Increased olfactory discrimination is also seen in the adaptation-defective mutant adp-1 (ky20). These various forms of behavioral plasticity enhance the ability of starved animals to respond to novel, potentially informative odorants."

Cadherin-mediated adhesions generate intracellular signals that control cytoskeletal reorganization, polarity, and vesicle trafficking. Among such signaling pathways, those involving small GTPases play critical roles in epithelial biogenesis. Assembly of E-cadherin activates several small GTPases and, in turn, the activated small GTPases control the effects of E-cadherin-mediated adhesions on epithelial biogenesis.

While human ribosome assembly is largely evolutionarily conserved, many of the regulatory details underlying its control and function have not yet been well-defined.

In addition, the PeBoW (BOP1–PES1–WDR12) complex has been well-defined as required for pre-28S rRNA processing and cell proliferation. In this study, we show that RSL24D1 depletion impairs both pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) transcription and mature 28S rRNA production, leading to decreased protein synthesis and p53 stabilization in human cells. Surprisingly, each of the PeBoW complex members is also required for pre-rRNA transcription. We demonstrate that RSL24D1 and WDR12 coimmunoprecipitate with the RNA polymerase I subunit, RPA194, and regulate its steady-state levels. These results uncover the dual role of RSL24D1 and the PeBoW complex in multiple steps of ribosome biogenesis, and provide evidence implicating large ribosomal subunit biogenesis factors in pre-rRNA transcription control."

In contrast, at promoters of average or highly expressed genes, SWI/SNF and NuRD antagonistically modulate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) release kinetics, arguably owing to accompanying alterations in H3.3 and H2A.Z levels at promoter-flanking nucleosomes, leading to paradoxical changes in gene expression. Owing to this mechanism, the relative activities of the two remodelers potentiate gene promoters toward Pol II–dependent open or PRC2-dependent closed chromatin states.

The unconditioned stimulus (US) is the event to be timed. The conditioned response (CR) is viewed as a prediction of the imminence of the US. Knowledge of the elapsed time between conditioned stimuli (CSs) and US delivery is expressed in the topological features of the CR. The peak amplitude of the CR coincides with the timing of the US. A simple connectionist network based on Sutton and Barto's Time Derivative (TD) Model of Pavlovian Reinforcement provides a mechanism that can account for and simulate CR timing in a variety of protocols. This article describes extensions of the model to predictive timing under temporal uncertainty. The model is expressed in terms of equations that operate in real time according to a competitive learning rule. The unfolding of time from the onsets and offsets of events such as CSs is represented by the propagation of activity along a sequence of time-tagged elements. The model can be aligned with anatomical circuits of the cerebellum and brain stem that are essential for learning and performance of conditioned eye-blink responses.

Aptamer anticoagulants provide potent and antidote-controllable anticoagulation and have low immunogenicity. New methods of aptamer isolation and engineering have not only improved the quality of aptamers, but also accelerated their development.

Equipotent mouse ribosomal protein promoters have a similar architecture that includes internal sequence elements.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.11.1789,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/11/1789,3,11,11/01/1989,1789,1800,"['N Hariharan', 'D E Kelley', 'R P Perry']","['Institute for Cancer Research, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111.']","The promoters of the mouse ribosomal protein genes rpL30, rpL32, and rpS16 are of equal strength, as indicated by in vivo measurements of polymerase loading and by their relative efficiency in driving the expression of a linked reporter gene. The equipotency of these promoters appears to derive from a remarkably similar architecture in which five or more elements are distributed over a 200-bp region that spans a polypyrimidine-embedded cap site. Three trans-acting factors are shared by the rpL30 and rpL32 promoters, one of which, delta, recognizes a common CNGCCATCT motif in the first (untranslated) exons. Site-specific mutagenesis demonstrated that delta-factor binding is critical for rpL30 promoter function. The repeated occurrence of this novel promoter architecture among ribosomal protein genes with very different coding specificities is most readily explained by convergent evolution."
Environmental enrichment and postnatal handling prevent spatial learning deficits in aged hypoemotional (Roman high-avoidance) and hyperemotional (Roman low-avoidance) rats.,Learning & Memory,Learn.

Two groups of 5-month-old rats from both lines were also included in the experiment as young controls. The Roman lines performed differently in the Morris water maze: Path lengths of RLA/Verh rats were shorter and they swam at lower speed than RHA/Verh rats, showing quicker and more efficient learning overall. Postnatal handling improved learning mainly in RHA/Verh rats, whereas environmental enrichment was able to prevent the deficits shown by aged controls of both lines. Young, enriched, and handled plus enriched animals exhibited better performance than impaired aged controls, to the point that aged enriched and handled plus enriched animals did not differ from young controls. Thus, besides indicating that RLA/Verh rats are better learners than RHA/Verh rats in the Morris water maze, this study demonstrates that environmental enrichment prevents the cognitive loss associated with aging, over the long term. Finally, the positive effects obtained with postnatal handling were dependent on the rat line."
"Loss of Ras activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is suppressed by disruptions of a new kinase gene, YAKI, whose product may act downstream of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase.",Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.9.1336,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/9/1336,3,9,09/01/1989,1336,1348,"['S Garrett', 'J Broach']","['Department of Biology, Princeton University, New Jersey 08544.']","The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two functionally redundant genes RAS1 and RAS2, which are homologous to the mammalian ras gene family and are required for vegetative growth. We isolated and characterized five temperature-sensitive alleles of RAS2. In a ras1 strain, these alleles cause growth arrest at the G1 stage of the cell cycle. Revertants capable of growth at the nonpermissive temperature define four recessive, extragenic complementation groups. Suppressors in one complementation group (designated yak1) are particularly intriguing because they appear to alleviate only the growth defect of the temperature-sensitive ras mutants and do not show any of the phenotypes, such as heat shock sensitivity or starvation sensitivity, associated with increased production of cAMP. The YAK1 gene has been cloned, and disruptions generated in vitro reveal that it is not essential for growth and that its loss confers growth to a strain deleted for tpk1, tpk2, and tpk3, the structural genes for the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These results place Yak1 downstream from, or on a parallel pathway to, the kinase step in the Ras/cAMP pathway. Finally, the coding region predicts a protein with significant homology to the family of protein kinases, suggesting that loss of cAMP-dependent protein kinase function can be suppressed by the loss of a second protein kinase."

Moreover, compared with traditional dUTP-based strand-specific RNA sequencing, this method detects more genes, has a higher strand specificity, and shows more evenly distributed reads across genes.

We compute the value of slowing aging in a range of countries and estimate that increasing life expectancy by 1 year has an annual benefit of ∼4%–5% of gross domestic product (GDP). Augmenting GDP with these measures of health gains reveals the growing importance of achieving healthy longevity as a means of boosting welfare, with the need being particularly acute in the United States."

The results suggest that the usefulness of this strategy comes less from its ability to increase robustness to morphogen source fluctuations per se, than from its ability to overcome specific kinds of noise, and to increase the fraction of a morphogen gradient within which robust threshold positions may be established. This work also provides new insights into the longstanding question of why morphogen gradients show a maximum range in vivo."

Outcomes of preclinical studies and clinical trials indicate that the selection of stimulation parameters has a direct impact on therapeutic efficacy and patient tolerability, suggesting that both the efficacy and tolerability of VNS could potentially be improved with a change in stimulation parameters. In this review, the success of translating stimulation parameters for epilepsy and heart failure from preclinical studies in animal models to human use in the clinic is evaluated on the basis of patient outcomes and stimulation-induced side effects. Data suggest that patients receiving VNS for epilepsy may experience improved seizure reduction by increasing the frequency and/or duty cycle of stimulation as well as incorporating closed-loop systems to deliver stimulation closer to seizure onset. Further, data suggest that VNS for heart failure is limited by the inability to activate the nerve fibers mediating therapeutic benefit without co-activation of side effect–inducing fibers. This may explain why pivotal trials of VNS for heart failure failed to meet primary efficacy outcomes despite promising preclinical outcomes in animal models. Improved characterization of the relationship between the stimulation parameter space and recruitment of the underlying fiber populations will likely expand the use of VNS to treat a variety of diseases and also improve upon current understanding of the mechanisms of action underlying VNS."

WGS was performed on his primary cancer revealing a hypermutated tumor, including clonal ultraviolet radiation-induced mutational patterns (Signature 7) and subclonal signatures of mutated DNA polymerase epsilon ( POLE ) (Signature 10). These signatures are associated with response to immune checkpoint blockade. Immunohistochemistry confirmed high PD-L1 expression in metastatic deposits. The anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab was commenced off-label given the POLE mutation and high mutational load. After four cycles, there was a significant reduction in his disease with almost complete resolution of the metastatic deposits. This case highlights the importance of WGS in the analysis, interpretation, and treatment of cancers. We anticipate that as WGS becomes integral to the cancer diagnostic pathway, treatments will be stratified to the individual based on their unique genomic and/or transcriptomic profile, enhancing classical approaches of histologically driven treatment decisions."

In addition, natural compounds extracted from tissues of Kalanchoë have potential applicability in treating tumors and inflammatory and allergic diseases, and have been shown to have insecticidal properties. Kalanchoë daigremontiana (Hamet & Perrier) originated in Madagascar and reproduces asexually by spontaneously forming whole plantlets on leaves. Plantlets develop symmetrically along the leaf margins on leaf notches, closely resembling zygotic embryos in development, and once the root system is formed, they detach from the mother-leaf, fall to the ground, and grow into new plants. This phenomenon is also found in other species from this same genus; however, the formation of leaf-plantlets is variable among species. Nevertheless, all species illustrate the remarkable ability of plant somatic cells to regenerate an entire organism, which has fascinated the scientific community for many years. It was only recently that the morphogenic process involved in the origin of K. daigremontiana plantlets was determined using molecular and genetic tools: K. daigremontiana forms plantlets by co-opting both organogenesis and embryogenesis programs into leaves. The ability of K. daigremontiana species to form somatic embryos outside of a seed environment provides an attractive model system to study somatic embryogenesis in nature, particularly the molecular mechanism involved in the acquisition of competence by vegetative cells to make embryos without fertilization."

However, cells can also polarize in the absence of an external cue. For example, a motile cell, which initially has a more or less round shape, can lose its symmetry spontaneously even in a homogeneous environment and start moving in random directions. One of the principal determinants of cell polarity is the cortical actin network that underlies the plasma membrane. Tension in this network generated by myosin motors can be relaxed by rupture of the shell, leading to polarization. In this article, we discuss how simplified model systems can help us to understand the physics that underlie the mechanics of symmetry breaking."

N 6 -Methyladenosine modification (m 6 A), one of the most abundant cellular RNA modifications, regulates key processes in RNA metabolism during stress response. Gene expression profiles observed postinfection with different SARS-CoV-2 variants show changes in the expression of genes related to RNA catabolism, including m 6 A readers and erasers. We found that infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants causes a loss of m 6 A in cellular RNAs, whereas m 6 A is detected abundantly in viral RNA. METTL3, the m 6 A methyltransferase, shows an unusual cytoplasmic localization postinfection. The B.1.351 variant has a less-pronounced effect on METTL3 localization and loss of m 6 A than did the B.1 and B.1.1.7 variants. We also observed a loss of m 6 A upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in air/liquid interface cultures of human airway epithelia, confirming that m 6 A loss is characteristic of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Further, transcripts with m 6 A modification are preferentially down-regulated postinfection. Inhibition of the export protein XPO1 results in the restoration of METTL3 localization, recovery of m 6 A on cellular RNA, and increased mRNA expression. Stress granule formation, which is compromised by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is restored by XPO1 inhibition and accompanied by a reduced viral infection in vitro. Together, our study elucidates how SARS-CoV-2 inhibits the stress response and perturbs cellular gene expression in an m 6 A-dependent manner."

Genetic mapping indicates that these mutations are inseparable from the known muscle myosin heavy-chain (MHC) allele Mhc1, and each mutation results in a muscle-specific reduction in MHC protein accumulation. The indirect flight muscles (IFMs) of each of these homozygous mutants fail to accumulate MHC, lack thick filaments, and do not display normal cylindrical myofibrils. As opposed to the null phenotype observed in the IFM, normal amounts of MHC accumulate in the leg muscles of three of these mutants, whereas the fourth mutant shows a 45% reduction in leg muscle MHC. The ultrastructure of the tergal depressor of the trochanter muscle TDT, or jump muscle) is normal in one mutant, completely lacks thick filaments in a second mutant, and displays a reduction of thick filaments in two mutants. The thick filament reduction in this latter class of mutants is limited to the four smaller anterior cells of the TDT, indicating that the TDT is a mixed fiber-type muscle. Because all isoforms of muscle MHC are encoded by alternative splicing of transcripts from a single gene, our results suggest that there is a complex pattern of MHC isoform accumulation in Drosophila. The phenotypes of the homozygous-viable mutants provide evidence for the differential localization of MHC isoforms in different muscles, within the same muscle, and even within a single muscle cell. The mutant characteristics also suggest that the use of some alternative exons is shared among the IFM, TDT, and additional muscles whereas the use of others is unique to the IFM."

Results demonstrate the emergence of chronic deficits in working memory among animals exposed to footshock by 3 wk after traumatic stress. The presentation of a trauma-paired odor cue was associated with further decrement in working memory performance for male animals. Furthermore, anxiety-like behaviors associated with the PTSD-like phenotype could predict the degree of working memory impairment in response to the trauma-paired odor cue. This study enhances validation of an existing rodent model of PTSD through replication of the clinical observations of working memory deficits associated with PTSD and provides novel insight into effects in female rodents.

While proteome-wide methodologies have enormously expanded the repertoire of known RBPs, these methods do not distinguish RBPs binding to small noncoding RNAs from the rest. To specifically identify this relevant subclass of RBPs, we developed small noncoding RNA interactome capture (snRIC 2C ) based on the differential RNA-binding capacity of silica matrices (2C). We define the S. cerevisiae proteome of nearly 300 proteins that specifically binds to RNAs smaller than 200 nt in length (snRBPs), identifying informative distinctions from the total RNA-binding proteome determined in parallel. Strikingly, the snRBPs include most glycolytic enzymes from yeast. With further methodological developments using silica matrices, 12 tRNAs were identified as specific binders of the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH. We show that tRNA engagement of GAPDH is carbon source–dependent and regulated by the RNA polymerase III repressor Maf1, suggesting a regulatory interaction between glycolysis and RNA polymerase III activity. We conclude that snRIC 2C and other 2C-derived methods greatly facilitate the study of RBPs, revealing previously unrecognized interactions."

Several commercial and noncommercial artificial mosquito feeders are available, but obstacles like high cost and complex assembly can restrict their routine use. To address this issue, a number of feeders have been designed that can be built with common materials found in the laboratory. They are cheaper and more accessible, but the absence of built-in temperature control and heating units can limit their efficacy. One of the most accessible mosquito feeders is the Glytube. It consists of a 50-mL conical centrifuge tube with heated glycerol that delivers blood through a membrane. The Glytube has been used successfully to model mosquito blood feeding. Recently, 3D printing has emerged as an alternative method to create customized artificial feeders. This technology is expected to facilitate access to and reduce the cost of these devices with open-source 3D model files that can be shared among laboratories maintaining mosquitoes worldwide."

However, only recently have these techniques been applied specifically to the evaluation of conditions affecting nerve and muscle. This specific application, termed electrical impedance myography (EIM), is finding wide application as it can provide a quantitative index of muscle condition that can assist with diagnosis, track disease progression, and assess the beneficial impact of therapy. Using noninvasive surface methods, EIM has been studied in a number of conditions ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to muscular dystrophy to disuse atrophy. Data support that the technique is sensitive to disease status and can offer the possibility of performing clinical trials with fewer subjects than would otherwise be possible. Recent advances in the field include improved approaches for using EIM as a “virtual biopsy” and the development of combined needle impedance-electromyography technology."

The large T splicing pathway uses multiple lariat branch sites, whereas small t splicing, constrained by its small intron size, can use only one. We exploited this situation to test the hypothesis that RNA-RNA base pairing between U2 snRNA and the branch site sequence is important in mammalian pre-mRNA splicing by constructing and analyzing several mutations in the small t pre-mRNA branch site (UUCUAAU). All of the mutations resulted in substantial decreases in small t splicing relative to large T. To test whether these effects resulted from decreased base pairing with U2 snRNA, compensatory mutations were introduced at the appropriate positions (nucleotides 34-36) in a cloned human U2 gene. All branch site mutations tested (four separate single base substitutions and two triple mutations) were suppressed (i.e., small t splicing was increased) by the appropriate U2 mutations. These results establish that recognition of the poorly conserved mammalian pre-mRNA branch site sequence by U2 snRNP can involve base-pairing."

One of the hallmark age-related changes in sleep is the reduction of sleep spindles and slow waves. Gray matter neurodegeneration is related to both age-related changes in sleep and age-related changes in memory, including memory for problem-solving skills. Here, we investigated whether spindles and slow waves might serve as biological markers for neurodegeneration of gray matter and for the related memory consolidation deficits in older adults. Forty healthy young adults (20–35 yr) and 30 healthy older adults (60–85 yr) were assigned to either nap or wake conditions. Participants were trained on the Tower of Hanoi in the morning, followed by either a 90-min nap opportunity or period of wakefulness, and were retested afterward. We found that age-related changes in sleep spindles and slow waves were differentially related to gray matter intensity in young and older adults in brain regions that support sleep-dependent memory consolidation for problem-solving skills. Specifically, we found that spindles were related to gray matter in neocortical areas (e.g., somatosensory and parietal cortex), and slow waves were related to gray matter in the anterior cingulate, hippocampus, and caudate, all areas known to support problem-solving skills. These results suggest that both sleep spindles and slow waves may serve as biological markers of age-related neurodegeneration of gray matter and the associated reduced benefit of sleep for memory consolidation in older adults."

The other four introns are somewhat longer and contain sequences homologous to U15 RNA; two of these represent functional copies, as shown by microinjections of Fugu transcripts into Xenopus oocytes, whereas the other two appear to be nonfunctional pseudocopies. Thus Fugu turns out to be ideal for the study of intron encoded snoRNAs, partly because of the reduced cloning and sequencing workload, and partly because the intron length per se can be an indication of the presence of a snoRNA coding sequence."

Although a number of cellular proteins have been shown to be involved in picornavirus RNA translation, the precise role of these factors in picornavirus internal ribosome entry is not understood. In this report, we provide evidence for the existence of distinct mechanisms for the internal initiation of translation between type I and type II picornavirus IRES elements. In vitro translation reactions were conducted in HeLa cell cytoplasmic translation extracts that were depleted of the cellular protein, poly(rC) binding protein 2 (PCBP2). Upon depletion of PCBP2, these extracts possessed a significantly diminished capacity to translate reporter RNAs containing the type I IRES elements of poliovirus, coxsackievirus, or human rhinovirus linked to luciferase; however, the addition of recombinant PCBP2 could reconstitute translation. Furthermore, RNA electrophoretic mobility-shift analysis demonstrated specific interactions between PCBP2 and both type I and type II picornavirus IRES elements; however, the translation of reporter RNAs containing the type II IRES elements of encephalomyocarditis virus and foot-and-mouth disease virus was not PCBP2 dependent. These data demonstrate that PCBP2 is essential for the internal initiation of translation on picornavirus type I IRES elements but is dispensable for translation directed by the structurally distinct type II elements."

The role of segment polarity genes during Drosophila neurogenesis.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.6.890,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/6/890,3,6,06/01/1989,890,904,"['N H Patel', 'B Schafer', 'C S Goodman', 'R Holmgren']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biochemistry, University of California--Berkeley 94720.']","Segment polarity genes in Drosophila are required for the proper formation of epidermal pattern within each segment. Here we show that certain segment polarity genes are also critical for the determination of specific neuronal identities in the developing central nervous system (CNS) of the Drosophila embryo. For several mutants, however, the pattern defects do not simply parallel their cuticular phenotypes. In fused, armadillo, and cubitus interruptus Dominant mutants, much of the CNS appears relatively normal. In hedgehog mutants, the CNS is highly disorganized, but this disruption may occur secondary to the initial events of neurogenesis. The specific cellular defects in patched mutants suggests that this gene specifies a subset of neuroblasts and neural progeny underlying the region of epidermal pattern defect. gooseberry mutants display a complex series of alterations in neuronal identity both underlying and outside of the region of epidermal modification. Neuronal identities of a set of cells along the midline appear to be changed in Cell mutants. The phenotype of wingless mutants is the most restricted and may be due to improper communication between sibling neurons. Thus, in addition to their functions in epidermal pattern formation, at least four of the segment polarity genes (gooseberry, patched, Cell, and wingless) appear to have specific roles in the control of cell fates during neurogenesis."

AML with BCR::ABL has only recently been provisionally classified by the World Health Organization as a diagnostically distinct subtype of AML. Discernment from the extremely close differential diagnosis of myeloid blast crisis CML is challenging, largely relying on medical history rather than clinical characteristics (Arber et al., Blood  127: 2391 [2016]). To gain insight into the genomic features underlying the evolution of AML with BCR::ABL, we identified a patient presenting with a high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome that acquired a BCR::ABL alteration after a peripheral blood stem cell transplant. Serial samples were collected and analyzed using whole-exome sequencing, RNA-seq, and ex vivo functional drug screens. Persistent subclones were identified, both at diagnosis and at relapse, including an SF3B1 p.Lys700Glu mutation that later cooccurred with an NRAS p.Gly12Cys mutation. Functional ex vivo drug screening performed on primary patient cells suggested that combination therapies of ABL1 with RAS or PI3K pathway inhibitors could have augmented the patient's response throughout the course of disease. Together, our findings argue for the importance of genomic profiling and the potential value of ABL1 inhibitor–inclusive combination treatment strategies in patients with this rare disease."

These phenotypic features overlap well with previously reported patients harboring biallelic MSTO1 variants. Additionally, our patient presents with dysphagia and restrictive lung disease, not previously reported for MSTO1 -associated disorders. The majority of patients with disease-associated variants in MSTO1 present with biallelic variants suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance; however, one family has been reported with a single variant and presumed autosomal dominant inheritance. The pattern of inheritance we observed is consistent with the majority of previous reports suggesting an autosomal recessive disorder. We add to our knowledge of the syndrome caused by variants in MSTO1 and provide additional evidence supporting autosomal recessive inheritance. We also describe phenotypic features not reported in previous cases, although further research is needed to confirm they are associated with defects in MSTO1."

Prior characterizations of the transcriptional network driving adipogenesis have overlooked transiently acting transcription factors (TFs), genes, and regulatory elements that are essential for proper differentiation. Moreover, traditional gene regulatory networks provide neither mechanistic details about individual regulatory element–gene relationships nor temporal information needed to define a regulatory hierarchy that prioritizes key regulatory factors. To address these shortcomings, we integrate kinetic chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and nascent transcription (PRO-seq) data to generate temporally resolved networks that describe TF binding events and resultant effects on target gene expression. Our data indicate which TF families cooperate with and antagonize each other to regulate adipogenesis. Compartment modeling of RNA polymerase density quantifies how individual TFs mechanistically contribute to distinct steps in transcription. The glucocorticoid receptor activates transcription by inducing RNA polymerase pause release, whereas SP and AP-1 factors affect RNA polymerase initiation. We identify Twist2 as a previously unappreciated effector of adipocyte differentiation. We find that TWIST2 acts as a negative regulator of 3T3-L1 and primary preadipocyte differentiation. We confirm that Twist2 knockout mice have compromised lipid storage within subcutaneous and brown adipose tissue. Previous phenotyping of Twist2 knockout mice and Setleis syndrome Twist2 − / − patients noted deficiencies in subcutaneous adipose tissue. This network inference framework is a powerful and general approach for interpreting complex biological phenomena and can be applied to a wide range of cellular processes."

However, the integrity of the data and the pace at which novel sequences can be identified depends to a great extent on the cDNA libraries that are used. Because altogether, in a typical cell, the mRNAs of the prevalent and intermediate frequency classes comprise as much as 50-65% of the total mRNA mass, but represent no more than 1000-2000 different mRNAs, redundant identification of mRNAs of these two frequency classes is destined to become overwhelming relatively early in any such random gene discovery programs, thus seriously compromising their cost-effectiveness. With the goal of facilitating such efforts, previously we developed a method to construct directionally cloned normalized cDNA libraries and applied it to generate infant brain (INIB) and fetal liver/spleen (INFLS) libraries, from which a total of 45,192 and 86,088 expressed sequence tags, respectively, have been derived. While improving the representation of the longest cDNAs in our libraries, we developed three additional methods to normalize cDNA libraries and generated over 35 libraries, most of which have been contributed to our integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and Their Expression (IMAGE) Consortium and thus distributed widely and used for sequencing and mapping. In an attempt to facilitate the process of gene discovery further, we have also developed a subtractive hybridization approach designed specifically to eliminate (or reduce significantly the representation of) large pools of arrayed and (mostly) sequenced clones from normalized libraries yet to be (or just partly) surveyed. Here we present a detailed description and a comparative analysis of four methods that we developed and used to generate normalize cDNA libraries from human (15), mouse (3), rat (2), as well as the parasite Schistosoma mansoni (1). In addition, we describe the construction and preliminary characterization of a subtracted liver/spleen library (INFLS-SI) that resulted from the elimination (or reduction of representation) of -5000 INFLS-IMAGE clones from the INFLS library."

Rats were trained in an eight-arm radial maze under different conditions as defined by the presence or absence of supplementary olfactory cues marking each arm, the availability of distant visuospatial information, and the illumination of the maze (light or darkness). The different visual conditions were designed to dissociate among the effects of light per se and those of visuospatial cues, on the use of olfactory cues for accurate arm choice. Different procedures with modifications of the arrangement of olfactory cues were used to determine if rats formed a representation of the spatial configuration of the olfactory cues and if they could rely on such a representation for accurate arm choice in the radial maze. The present study demonstrated that the use of olfactory cues to direct arm choice in the radial arm maze was critically dependent on the illumination conditions and implied two different modes of processing of olfactory information according to the presence or the absence of light. Olfactory cues were used in an explicit manner and enabled accurate arm choice only in the absence of light. Rats, however, had an implicit memory of the location of the olfactory cues and formed a representation of the spatial position of these cues, whatever the lighting conditions. They did not memorize the spatial configuration of the olfactory cues per se but needed these cues to be linked to the external spatial frame of reference."

Action was not observed with a truncated v-myb protein lacking its DNA-binding domain. We also observed that expression of a hybrid human HSP70 promoter/CAT gene, lacking myb-specific binding sites, was activated by v-myb.

The mechanisms by which the protein homeostasis system acts to control protein aggregation are, however, still not known in much detail. To facilitate systematic investigations of these mechanisms, we describe here the CamSol method of predicting protein solubility, and illustrate its initial applications. We anticipate that with the advent of powerful proteomics and transcriptomic methods, in combination with the use of the CamSol method and related approaches to predict the solubility and other biophysical properties of proteins, it will become possible to increase our understanding of the principles of protein homeostasis related to the maintenance of the proteome in its soluble form."

One allele of the new suppressor class, prlG1, has been characterized in some detail. This suppressor counteracts, to some degree, the export defect conferred by a variety of signal-sequence mutations in two different genes, lamB and malE.

However, GA treatment influences both innate and adaptive immune compartments, and it is now recognized that antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are the initial cellular targets for GA.

Characterization of the mouse histone gene cluster on chromosome 13: 45 histone genes in three patches spread over 1Mb.,Genome Research,Genome Res.,1088-9051,1549-5469,10.1101/gr.6.8.688,https://genome.cshlp.org/content/6/8/688,6,8,08/01/1996,688,701,"['Z F Wang', 'T Krasikov', 'M R Frey', 'J Wang', 'A G Matera', 'W F Marzluff']","['Department of Biology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 27599-7100, USA.']","The histone gene cluster on mouse chromosome 13 has been isolated and characterized. Using overlapping YAC clones containing histone genes from chromosome 13, a contig of approximately 2 Mb has been defined. It contains 45 histone genes, organized in three patches containing tightly clustered genes. An 80-kb patch (patch III) containing 12 histone genes is near one end of the contig, and a similar-sized patch (patch I) containing 15 histone genes is near the other end of the contig, located at least 500 kb from the central patch (patch II) of histone genes. The entire cluster contains six histone H1 genes, including the testis-specific histone H1t gene that maps to the middle of the cluster. All nine histone H3 genes in this cluster have been sequenced, and their level of expression determined. Each histone H3 gene is distinct, with five genes encoding the H3.2 protein subtype and four genes encoding the H3.1 protein. They are all expressed, with each histone H3 gene accounting for a small proportion of the total histone H3 mRNA."

The protein coding region of this cDNA was identical in sequence to the extracellular domain of the rat liver GH receptor up to three amino acids before the putative transmembrane domain. At this point, an additional 17 amino acids were encoded in the GH-binding protein before a stop codon was encountered. This cDNA clone was shown to be representative of the structure of the mRNA present in rat liver. These results suggest that the mechanism for production of the rat serum GH-binding protein is by alternative splicing of the gene for the rat GH receptor."
Cerebellar guidance of premotor network development and sensorimotor learning.,Learning & Memory,Learn.

These data are consistent with the hypothesis that particular sensorimotor procedures are acquired and stored in the cerebellar cortex and that this knowledge can then be exported to the cerebral cortex and premotor networks for more efficient execution. In this article we present a model to illustrate how the cerebellar cortex might guide the development of cortical-cerebellar network connections and how a similar mechanism operating in the adult could mediate the exportation of sensorimotor knowledge from the cerebellum to the motor cortex. The model consists of a three-layered recurrent network representing the cerebello-thalamocortical-ponto-cerebellar limb premotor network. The cerebellar cortex is not explicitly modeled. Our simulations show that Hebbian learning combined with weight normalization allows the emergence of reciprocal and modular structure in the limb premotor network. Reciprocal connections allow activity to reverberate around specific loops. Modularity organizes the connections into specific channels. Furthermore, we show that cerebellar learning can be exported to motor cortex through these modular and reciprocal premotor circuits. In particular, we simulate developmental alignment of visuomotor relations and their realignment as a consequence of prism exposure. The exportation of sensorimotor knowledge from the cerebellum to the motor cortex may allow faster and more efficient execution of learned motor responses."
An intragenic duplication of TRPS1 leading to abnormal transcripts and causing trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I,Molecular Case Studies,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud,,2373-2873,10.1101/mcs.a004655,http://molecularcasestudies.cshlp.org/content/5/6/a004655,5,6,12/01/2019,a004655,,"['Cinthya J.

Pathogenic variants in TRPS1 include missense mutations and deletions with variable breakpoints, with only a single instance of an intragenic duplication reported to date. Here we report an affected individual presenting with a classic TRPSI phenotype who is heterozygous for a de novo intragenic ∼36.3-kbp duplication affecting exons 2–4 of TRPS1 . Molecular analysis revealed the duplication to be in direct tandem orientation affecting the splicing of TRPS1 . The aberrant transcripts are predicted to produce a truncated TRPS1 missing the nuclear localization signal and the GATA and IKAROS-like zinc-finger domains resulting in functional TRPS1 haploinsufficiency. Our study identifies a novel intragenic tandem duplication of TRPS1 and highlights the importance of molecular characterization of intragenic duplications."

In this paper, we examine the role of Notch in the developing retina. We reduced Notch activity at successive intervals during development of the retina, and then examined the effect on individual cells. When Notch activity was reduced, cells responded by selecting inappropriate developmental pathways. We found that all cell types appear to require Notch when establishing their fate. To examine further Notch's role in eye development, we examined two alleles of Notch--split and facet-glossy. split flies show defects in the initial clustering of photoreceptors, whereas the defects in facet-glossy flies are due to the misrouting of presumptive primary pigment cells into the secondary pigment cell pathway. Our results suggest that Notch plays a permissive role in the cell-cell interactions used to assemble the eye."
Specific expression of a novel cell wall hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein gene in lateral root initiation.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.10.1639,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/10/1639,3,10,10/01/1989,1639,1646,"['B Keller', 'C J Lamb']","['Plant Biology Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037.']","A gene encoding a novel cell wall hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein (HRGPnt3) was isolated from a genomic library of tobacco. The deduced protein (620 amino acids, Mr, 65,406) contains an amino-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide, is highly basic, and is rich in proline, although characteristic Ser-Pro4 repeats are found only beyond residue 204. At the carboxyl terminus, there is a 34-amino-acid unit repeated three times. Arginine is the predominant basic amino acid rather than lysine, as in other HRGPs. A second gene homologous to HRGPnt3 was revealed by Southern blot hybridization of tobacco genomic DNA. Northern blot hybridization identified a 1.9-kb transcript present at low levels in roots. To determine the underlying spatial pattern of expression, the HRGPnt3 promoter and the first 27 nucleotides of the open reading frame were fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene and transformed back into tobacco. Histochemical localization of GUS activity showed that the HRGPnt3 promoter was transiently induced in the pericycle and endodermis, specifically in the discrete, small subset of cells involved in the initiation of lateral roots. This pattern of expression, in cells destined to form the tip of the emerging lateral root, indicates that the encoded cell wall protein has a specialized structural function, possibly in the mechanical penetration of the cortex and epidermis of the main root, and that the HRGPnt3 promoter responds to an early morphogenetic signal for lateral root induction."

Desmogleins and desmocollins, members of the cadherin superfamily, mediate adhesion at desmosomes. Cytoplasmic components of the desmosome associate with the desmosomal cadherin tails through a series of protein interactions, which serve to recruit intermediate filaments to sites of desmosome assembly. These desmosomal plaque components include plakoglobin and the plakophilins, members of the armadillo gene family. Linkage to the cytoskeleton is mediated by the intermediate filament binding protein, desmoplakin, which associates with both plakoglobin and plakophilins. Although desmosomes are critical for maintaining stable cell–cell adhesion, emerging evidence indicates that they are also dynamic structures that contribute to cellular processes beyond that of cell adhesion. This article outlines the structure and function of the major desmosomal proteins, and explores the contributions of this protein complex to tissue architecture and morphogenesis."

Two-color metaphase FISH can be used to order pairs of loci relative to the centromere; two- and three-color interphase FISH can be used to accurately order trios of loci spaced within 1 Mb relative to one another. Loci separated by a distance > 1-2 Mb exhibit chromatin loops that often give rise to a statistically significant but incorrect order. We derive Bayesian methods for selecting the best locus order based on microscopic evaluation for each of these types of FISH mapping data. We then describe how the results from several two- and three-locus analyses can be combined to evaluate the approximate posterior probability of a given multilocus order within the limits of the technology utilized. These methods directly address the question of interest: What is the probability that the inferred two-, three-, or multilocus order actually is correct? We illustrate our analysis methods by applying them to previously described FISH mapping data of 14 markers in the BRCA1 region on chromosome 17q12-q21. We also propose design strategies to order a group of closely spaced (< 1 Mb) loci, two and three loci at a time, using a bisection strategy for two-color FISH data and a trisection strategy for three-color FISH data. These strategies have the best worst-case performance for ordering a new locus relative to a group of ordered loci and are nearly optimal for ordering a group of loci of unknown order. These, in conjunction with physical mapping strategies, provide efficient and reliable methods for gene map construction by FISH."

In this article, we discuss the functions of morphogen and gene expression gradients in the assembly of the nervous system in the context of the development of the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is a mammal-specific region of the forebrain that functions at the top of the neural hierarchy to process and interpret sensory information, plan and organize tasks, and to control motor functions. The mature cerebral cortex is a modular structure, consisting of anatomically and functionally distinct areas. Those areas of neurons are generated from a uniform neuroepithelial sheet by two forms of gradients: graded extracellular signals and a set of transcription factor gradients operating across the field of neocortical stem cells. Fgf signaling from the rostral pole of the cerebral cortex sets up gradients of expression of transcription factors by both activating and repressing gene expression. However, in contrast to the spinal cord and the early Drosophila embryo, these gradients are not subsequently resolved into molecularly distinct domains of gene expression. Instead, graded information in stem cells is translated into discrete, region-specific gene expression in the postmitotic neuronal progeny of the stem cells."

Fox']","['Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Houston, Houston, Texas 77204-5001, USA']","The modern ribosome catalyzes all coded protein synthesis in extant organisms. It is likely that its core structure is a direct descendant from the ribosome present in the last common ancestor (LCA). Hence, its earliest origins likely predate the LCA and therefore date further back in time. Of special interest is the pseudosymmetrical region (SymR) that lies deep within the large subunit (LSU) where the peptidyl transfer reaction takes place. It was previously proposed that two RNA oligomers, representing the P- and A-regions of extant ribosomes dimerized to create a pore-like structure, which hosted the necessary properties that facilitate peptide bond formation. However, recent experimental studies show that this may not be the case. Instead, several RNA constructs derived exclusively from the P-region were shown to form a homodimer capable of peptide bond synthesis. Of special interest will be the origin issues because the homodimer would have allowed a pre-LCA ribosome that was significantly smaller than previously proposed. For the A-region, the immediate issue will likely be its origin and whether it enhances ribosome performance. Here, we reanalyze the RNA/RNA interaction regions that most likely lead to SymR formation in light of these recent findings. Further, it has been suggested that the ability of these RNA constructs to dimerize and enhance peptide bond formation is sequence-dependent. We have analyzed the implications of sequence variations as parts of functional and nonfunctional constructs."

Copy-number variation analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data indicated increased coverage in exons 8–11 of MANBA . Low β-mannosidase activity (1 µkatal/kg protein, refv 25–40) established the diagnosis of β-mannosidosis. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and cDNA analysis revealed a novel homozygous intragenic inverted duplication in MANBA, where a 13.1-kb region between introns 7 and 11 was duplicated and inserted in an inverted orientation, creating a 67-base nonduplicated gap at the insertion point. Both junctions showed microhomology regions. The inverted duplication resulted in exon skipping of exons 8–9 or 8–10.

The protein is phosphorylated variably on serines of the cytoplasmic domain. Individual Notch polypeptide chains appear to be associated with one another by disulfide bonds, suggesting that homotypic interaction of these proteins is required for function. Immunocytochemistry has revealed striking features of Notch expression that might clarify its function: Cells of the ventral neurogenic ectoderm become conspicuously labeled with the protein prior to embryonic neurogenesis, and Notch appears to be associated with cells destined for both neural and epidermal lineages. High levels of Notch become restricted to neuroblasts as they delaminate from the embryonic ectoderm and are apposed to mesoderm. Mesodermal cells express Notch also, suggesting a possible involvement in neurogenesis, or an unknown role in mesoderm differentiation. In larvae and pupae, a correlation of expression and neuroblast mitotic activity is seen for many cells. Notch produced by a dividing neuroblast may persist on derivative cells, including terminally differentiated neurons and nerve processes. In the larval eye imaginal disk, strong Notch expression appears in the morphogenetic furrow, uniformly on cell surfaces as they cluster to form ommatidia. Expression persists on ommatidia after release from the furrow. These patterns suggest a role for Notch in position-dependent development in both initiation and maintenance of cell-surface interactions. In the eye and embryonic ectoderm, uniform expression on cells interacting to produce different developmental lineages from a single primordium suggests that Notch alone may not be sufficient to elaborate cell fates."

Because the gradual consolidation of long-term memory is thought to occur across this time scale (weeks and months), the reaction time distributions of successfully retrieved items were analyzed in an attempt to detect markers of consolidation. At each retention interval, reaction times for items retrieved successfully were well fit by a model that assumed a single underlying distribution. No evidence for a bimodal distribution of reaction times was observed. Furthermore, there was no evidence that some small subset of items was actually retrieved faster after a long retention interval than after a short interval. The results are consistent with the idea that consolidation works not to increase memory trace strength but to change the nature of memory storage. This process occurs during the course of normal forgetting and may not be observable in the behavior of normal memory."

Unlike small molecules, RNA targeted drugs are not limited by the availability of binding pockets on the protein, but rather utilize Watson–Crick (WC) base-pairing rules to recognize the target RNA and modulate gene expression. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) present a powerful therapeutic approach to treat disorders triggered by genetic alterations. ASOs recognize the cognate site on the target RNA to alter gene expression. Nine single-stranded ASOs have been approved for clinical use and several candidates are in late-stage clinical trials for both rare and common diseases. Several chemical modifications, including phosphorothioates, locked nucleic acid, phosphorodiamidate, morpholino, and peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), have been investigated for efficient RNA targeting. PNAs are synthetic DNA mimics where the deoxyribose phosphate backbone is replaced by N-(2-aminoethyl)-glycine units. The neutral pseudopeptide backbone of PNAs contributes to enhanced binding affinity and high biological stability. PNAs hybridize with the complementary site in the target RNA and act by a steric hindrance­–based mechanism. In the last three decades, various PNA designs, chemical modifications, and delivery strategies have been explored to demonstrate their potential as an effective and safe RNA-targeting platform. This review covers the advances in PNA-mediated targeting of coding and noncoding RNAs for a myriad of therapeutic applications."

However, memory is not a monolith and draws from different kinds of representations. Historically, much of our understanding of age-related memory decline stems from recognition of isolated studied items. In contrast, real-life events are often remembered as narratives, and this kind of information is generally missed in typical recognition memory studies. Here, we designed a task to tax mnemonic discrimination of event details, directly contrasting perceptual and narrative memory. Older and younger adults watched an episode of a television show and later completed an old/new recognition test featuring targets, novel foils, and similar lures in narrative and perceptual domains. While we observed no age-related differences on basic recognition of repeated targets and novel foils, older adults showed a deficit in correctly rejecting perceptual, but not narrative, lures. These findings provide insight into the vulnerability of different memory domains in aging and may be useful in characterizing individuals at risk for pathological cognitive decline."

In this special issue of RNA , we gathered expert perspectives on the past, present, and future of the field, to serve as a primer and also a challenge to the broad scientific community to incorporate RNA into their experimental design and problem-solving process, and to imagine and realize the potential of RNA as a therapeutic drug or target."

The fine-tuning of the NF-κB DNA binding activity is essential for its fundamental function as a transcription factor. An increasing body of literature illustrates that this process can be elegantly and specifically controlled at multiple levels by different protein subsets. In particular, the recent identification of a non-Rel subunit of NF-κB itself provides a new way to understand the selective high-affinity DNA binding specificity of NF-κB conferred by a synergistic interaction within the whole complex. Here, we review the mechanism of the specification of DNA binding activity of NF-κB complexes, one of the most important aspects of NF-κB transcriptional control."

During the study phase of each trial, rats were allowed to visit each of eight arms once in an order that was randomly selected or fixed for that trial. The test phase required the rats to choose which of two arms occurred earlier in the sequence of arms visited during the study phase. The arms selected as test arms varied according to temporal distance (0, 2, 4, or 6) or the number of arms that occurred between the two test arms in the study phase. For the variable sequences based on new information, control rats showed an increasing temporal distance function. Relative to control rats, medial prefrontal cortex-lesioned rats displayed a temporal order memory deficit across all distances. For the constant sequence based on familiar information, control rats performed well across all distances. Relative to controls, the medial prefrontal cortex-lesioned rats displayed a performance deficit. The results support the idea that the medial prefrontal cortex contributes to mnemonic operations associated with temporal order for new and familiar spatial location information."

The structural organization of the ER is very dynamic and complex, with distinct subdomains such as the nuclear envelope and the peripheral ER organized into ER sheets and tubules. ER also forms physical contact sites with all other cellular organelles and with the plasma membrane. Both form and function of the ER are highly adaptive, with a potent capacity to respond to transient changes in environmental cues such as nutritional fluctuations. However, under obesity-induced chronic stress, the ER fails to adapt, leading to ER dysfunction and the development of metabolic pathologies such as insulin resistance and fatty liver disease. Here, we discuss how the remodeling of ER structure and contact sites with other organelles results in diversification of metabolic function and how perturbations to this structural flexibility by chronic overnutrition contribute to ER dysfunction and metabolic pathologies in obesity."

Cytologic findings from the cyst fluid were consistent with a mucinous neoplastic cyst, and the possibility of malignancy could not be entirely excluded. A KRAS mutation analysis was performed on the cyst fluid using the Idylla system and circulating tumor KRAS (ctKRAS) cartridge (Biocartis, Mechelen, Belgium), which tests for actionable mutations in exons 2, 3, and 4 of the KRAS gene. Idylla testing detected a KRAS G12D mutation in the cyst fluid. The patient subsequently underwent a distal subtotal pancreatectomy with splenectomy. Microscopic examination of the resected tissue revealed an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) with an associated invasive carcinoma. KRAS testing on the resected tumor tissue confirmed the G12D mutation detected in the cyst fluid earlier. The described rapid testing of KRAS directly from the pancreatic cyst fluid can complement cytology assessment to classify pancreatic cysts more reliably and can potentially be of significant help when other cyst findings are nondiagnostic."

In well-trained animals learning-related as well as stimulus-evoked unit activity can be recorded throughout the pontine nuclei but particularly in the lateral and dorsolateral pons. Recent work in our laboratory has provided evidence that the learning-related unit activity in the pons is dependent on the interpositus nucleus and that the pons is not a site of essential plasticity for the learned response. In the present study we considered the question of whether learning-related unit activity might be projected from the interpositus nucleus to the pons through the red nucleus, a primary output target of the interpositus and a structure known to be essential for expression of the learned response. Multiple unit recordings were taken from lateral and dorsolateral pontine locations in well-trained rabbits before and during cooling of the red nucleus. Analysis of pooled data for all recording locations within the lateral and dorsolateral pons indicated that reversible inactivation of red nucleus abolished both stimulus-evoked and learning-related unit activity. However, we also found discrete recording locations where stimulus-evoked and learning-related unit activity were attenuated but not abolished by red nucleus cooling."

Such fields have remained an abstract concept until the recent identification of their molecular components using a combination of genetics, biochemistry, and theoretical modeling. One of the best studied models of a morphogenetic field is the Dorsal-Ventral (D-V) patterning of the early frog embryo. This patterning system is regulated by the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway and an intricate network of secreted protein antagonists. This biochemical pathway of interacting proteins functions in the extracellular space to generate a D-V gradient of BMP signaling, which is maintained during extensive morphogenetic movements of cell layers during gastrulation. The D-V field is divided into a dorsal and a ventral center, in regions of low and high BMP signaling respectively, under opposite transcriptional control by BMPs. The robustness of the patterning is assured at two different levels. First, in the extracellular space by secreted BMP antagonists that generate a directional flow of BMP ligands to the ventral side. The flow is driven by the regulated proteolysis of the Chordin inhibitor and by the presence of a molecular sink on the ventral side that concentrates BMP signals. The tolloid metalloproteinases and the Chordin-binding protein Crossveinless-2 (CV2) are key components of this ventral sink. Second, by transcriptional feedback at the cellular level: The dorsal and ventral signaling centers adjust their size and level of BMP signaling by transcriptional feedback. This allows cells on one side of a gastrula containing about 10,000 cells to communicate with cells in the opposite pole of the embryo."

We have examined V(D)J recombination as a function of joining signal sequence. Plasmid substrates with mutations in one or both of the heptamer-spacer-nonamer sequences were tested for recombination in a pre-B-cell line active in V(D)J recombination. No signal variant recombines more efficiently than the consensus forms of the joining signals. We find the heptamer sequence to be the most important; specifically, the three bases closest to the recombination crossover site are critical. The nonamer is not as rigidly defined, and it is not important to maintain the five consecutive As that distinguish the consensus nonamer sequence. Both types of signals display very similar sequence requirements and have in common an intolerance for changes in spacer length greater than 1 bp. Although the two signal types share sequence motifs, we find no evidence of a role in recombination for homology between the signals, suggesting that they serve primarily as protein recognition and binding sites."

Studies of the biosynthetic pathway and physiological role of s 4 U in tRNA are ongoing in the tRNA modification field. s 4 U has also recently been utilized as a biotechnological tool for analysis of RNAs. Therefore, a selective and sensitive system for the detection of s 4 U is essential for progress in the fields of RNA technologies and tRNA modification. Here, we report the use of biotin-coupled 2-aminoethyl-methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA biotin-XX) for labeling of s 4 U and demonstrate that the system is sensitive and quantitative. This technique can be used without denaturation; however, addition of a denaturation step improves the limit of detection. Thermus thermophilus tRNAs, which abundantly contain 5-methyl-2-thiouridine, were tested to investigate the selectivity of the MTSEA biotin-XX s 4 U detection system. The system did not react with 5-methyl-2-thiouridine in tRNAs from a T. thermophilus tRNA 4-thiouridine synthetase ( thiI ) gene deletion strain. Thus, the most useful advantage of the MTSEA biotin-XX s 4 U detection system is that MTSEA biotin-XX reacts only with s 4 U and not with other sulfur-containing modified nucleosides such as s 2 U derivatives in tRNAs. Furthermore, the MTSEA biotin-XX s 4 U detection system can analyze multiple samples in a short time span. The MTSEA biotin-XX s 4 U detection system can also be used for the analysis of s 4 U formation in tRNA. Finally, we demonstrate that the MTSEA biotin-XX system can be used to visualize newly transcribed tRNAs in S. cerevisiae cells."

However, even with careful attention to these details, the spatial resolution of the optical tweezers is still fundamentally limited by the forces that induce Brownian fluctuations of the trapped microspheres. In this article, we focus on the ways in which the design and implementation of an experiment--the choice of bead size, tether length, and even the method in which the motions of the beads are monitored--can have a large impact on the fundamental resolution of the measurement. By investigating how the Brownian fluctuations depend on experimental parameters and the detection method, we develop a set of guidelines for designing a high-resolution experiment, with a prescription for minimizing the effect of Brownian fluctuations, thus maximizing the resolution of the experiment."

These effects have been reexamined; the experiments were buttressed by testing the effects of several recently isolated mutations at the dusky locus, along with the original And Allele that had been induced there. The reexamination was also prompted by anatomical concerns, certain of which have recently focused on dy-induced decrements in cell size, but only in terms of wing morphology. Another anatomical issue involves the discovery of a neuronal pathway that seems to connect circadian pacemaker cells to a structure in the Drosophila brain that is involved in learning. In observer-blind experiments, however, it was found that neither pacemaker-slowing (Andante-like) dy mutations nor others that cause no rhythm defects produced subnormal conditioned courtship. Moreover, in the adult brain of a slow-clock dyAnd mutant, no axonal pathway defects were readily discernible and putative pacemaker neurons appeared to be normal in size."

With substrates containing either linkage, the HDV ribozyme generated 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and 5'-hydroxyl groups suggesting that the mechanisms of cleavage in both cases were by a nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus center by the adjacent hydroxyl group. Divalent metal ion was required for cleavage of either linkage. However, although the 3',5'-linkage was cleaved slightly faster in Ca2+ than in Mg2+, the 2',5'-linkage was cleaved in Mg2+ (or Mn2+) but not Ca2+. This dramatic difference in metal-ion specificity is strongly suggestive of a crucial metal-ion interaction at the active site. In contrast to the HDV ribozymes, cleavage at a 2',5'-phosphodiester bond was not efficiently catalyzed by the hammerhead ribozyme. The relaxed linkage specificity of the HDV ribozymes may be due in part to lack of a rigid binding site for sequences 5' to the cleavage site."

The characteristic features were described in Finland in the beginning of 1990s. Having shown that IOSCA does not segregate with any of the markers linked to other hereditary ataxias and thus represents a genetically distinct disease, we assigned the locus of this new hereditary ataxia to 10q23.3-q24.1. To approximate the age of the Finnish IOSCA mutation and to investigate the possible existence of more than one mutation underlying the disease, the ancestors of 13 IOSCA families were identified by use of church records dating back to the 1500s. The IOSCA pedigrees were frequently merged, providing support for these having one common ancestor. Analysis of the extended IOSCA haplotypes exposed ancient recombination events and revealed one core haplotype of four markers on a region of approximately 2 cM, which was unequivocally present in 92% of disease chromosomes. Both genealogical and haplotype data thus suggest that a single IOSCA ancestral mutation was introduced into the Finnish population most probably approximately 30-40 generations ago before the time when the general east-west migration took place within Finland."

Subsequent work led to identification of oncogenic mutations that result in NF-κB activation in lymphoid malignancies, but most of these mutations affect upstream components of NF-κB signaling pathways, rather than NF-κB family members themselves. NF-κB activation has also been observed in many solid tumors, but so far no oncogenic mutations responsible for NF-κB activation in carcinomas have been identified. In such cancers, NF-κB activation is a result of underlying inflammation or the consequence of formation of an inflammatory microenvironment during malignant progression. Most importantly, through its ability to up-regulate the expression of tumor promoting cytokines, such as IL-6 or TNF-α, and survival genes, such as Bcl-X L , NF-κB provides a critical link between inflammation and cancer."

Single-stranded DNA molecules of 52-206 nucleotides in length were generated by asymmetric polymerase chain reactions (aPCR), using an excess of one short sense-strand primer to be extended and a limiting amount of each short antisense primer that is complementary to and defines the 3' end of the long primer to be generated. The noncross-linking strand of the DNA probe was also generated by aPCR from the DNA sequence of interest. The long primers were annealed to the full-length noncross-linking DNA strand to form a partially double-stranded DNA.

It presents primarily as “acute viral hepatitis” syndrome, usually a self-limiting illness. A few cases progress to acute liver failure, a serious illness with high fatality. Clinical disease is infrequent among children. Infection during pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of symptomatic disease, severe liver injury, and mortality. Severe disease is also encountered in persons with preexisting chronic liver disease. Some cases have associated extrahepatic features, particularly acute pancreatitis and neurological manifestations. Chronic infection appears to be extremely infrequent with these HEV genotypes. The exact pathogenesis of liver injury remains unknown, although the host immune response appears to be important for viral clearance as well as for induction of liver injury. Hormonal and immune factors appear to be responsible for the severe disease during pregnancy."

We now show that LTD cannot be induced in Purkinje neurons under whole-cell patch clamp in cerebellar slices from young adult mice genetically lacking neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). This genetic evidence confirms the essentiality of NO and nNOS for LTD in young adult rodents. Surprisingly, LTD in cells from nNOS knockout mice cannot be rescued by photolytic uncaging of NO and cGMP inside Purkinje neurons, although such stimuli circumvent acute pharmacological inhibition of nNOS and soluble guanylate cyclase in normal rodents. Also slices from knockout mice show no deficit in cGMP elevation in response to exogenous NO. Therefore, prolonged absence of nNOS allows atrophy of the signaling pathway downstream of cGMP."

These regions, including centromeres, long heterochromatic blocks, and rDNA arrays, have been difficult to analyze with respect to their diversity and origin. Greatly improved genome assemblies are now available that enable comparative genomics over these and other nongenic spaces. Using 26 complete maize genomes, we developed methods to align intergenic sequences while excluding genes and regulatory regions. The centromere haplotypes (cenhaps) extend for megabases on either side of the functional centromere regions and appear as evolutionary strata, with haplotype divergence/coalescence times dating as far back as 450 thousand years ago (kya). Application of the same methods to other low recombination regions (heterochromatic knobs and rDNA) and all intergenic spaces revealed that deep coalescence times are ubiquitous across the maize pan-genome. Divergence estimates vary over a broad timescale with peaks at ∼16 and 300 kya, reflecting a complex history of gene flow among diverging populations and changes in population size associated with domestication. Cenhaps and other long haplotypes provide vivid displays of this ancient diversity."

Exceptional responses to bortezomib can be achieved in KRAS G12D-mutant NSCLCs. KRAS G12D mutation alone, however, is not a robust predictor of response. Further evaluation should only be performed after further elucidation of other factors such as co-occurring alterations and histologic subtype such as IMA that may predict sensitivity to therapy."

Mutations in the kinesin motor protein gene KIF1C cause hereditary spastic paraplegia, an autosomal recessive disease leading to predominant degeneration of the long axons of central motoneurons. In this study, we aimed to gain insight into the molecular function of KIF1C and understand how KIF1C dysfunction contributes to motoneuron degeneration. We used affinity proteomics in neuronally differentiated neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) to identify the protein complex associated with KIF1C in neuronal cells; candidate interactions were then validated by immunoprecipitation, and mislocalization of putative KIF1C cargoes was studied by immunostainings. We found KIF1C to interact with all core components of the exon junction complex (EJC); expression of mutant KIF1C in neuronal cells leads to loss of the typical localization distally in neurites. Instead, EJC core components accumulate in the pericentrosomal region, here colocalizing with mutant KIF1C. These findings suggest KIF1C as a neuronal transporter of the EJC. Interestingly, the binding of KIF1C to the EJC is RNA-mediated, as treatment with RNase prior to immunoprecipitation almost completely abolishes the interaction. Silica-based solid-phase extraction of UV-cross-linked RNA–protein complexes furthermore supports direct interaction of KIF1C with RNA, as recently also demonstrated for kinesin heavy chain. Taken together, our findings are consistent with a model where KIF1C transports mRNA in an EJC-bound and therefore transcriptionally silenced state along neurites, thus providing the missing link between the EJC and mRNA localization in neurons."

Despite a significant body of literature detailing the biochemical and biological functions of p53, much remains to be elucidated. Indeed, the p53 network is as complex and enigmatic as it is relevant. It is the goal of this article, written 30 years after the discovery of p53, to present a concise review of the tumor suppressor role of the p53 network and to highlight the context-dependent nature of p53 target-gene functions."

Light sensing is therefore of paramount importance for plants. Thus, plants have evolved sophisticated light receptors and signaling networks that detect and respond to changes in light intensity, duration, and spectral quality. Environmental light signals can drive developmental transitions such as germination and flowering, but they also continuously shape development to allow adaptation to the local habitat and microclimate. The ability to respond to a changing and sometimes unfavorable environment underlies the huge success of plants. Much of this growth and developmental plasticity is achieved by light modulation of auxin signaling systems. In this article, we examine the connections between light and auxin that elicit local responses, long distance signaling, and coordinated growth between the shoot and root."

Sequences upstream from position -83 had little effect on the amount of RNA synthesized in vitro, using extracts prepared from Drosophila Kc tissue culture cells. Deletion of a 5'-flanking TATA consensus sequence had no effect on the accuracy of transcriptional initiation and resulted in an increase in RNA synthesis, suggesting removal of a repressor binding site. Surprisingly, removal of the first two nucleotides of the transcribed region still allowed relatively high levels of transcription from the correct start site position. Removal of five additional nucleotides inactivated the promoter. In vitro transcription of a series of 3' deletions defined the 3' in vitro promoter boundary at position +43. Additional 5'-flanking sequences, between -181 and -83, were found to be necessary for efficient transcription in transfected Kc tissue culture cells. Two transcription factors that interact with the E74 promoter, zeste and GAGA, were studied in DNA-binding assays. zeste binds to two sites within the E74 promoter. These sites overlap with three of the six GAGA-binding sites. The zeste- and GAGA-binding sites lie within domains identified by deletion mapping as cis-acting transcriptional control elements."

Their mechanism of action is based entirely on the sequence of validated disease-causing genes without the prerequisite knowledge of protein structure, activity or cellular location. In contrast to small molecule therapeutics that passively diffuse across the cell membrane's lipid bilayer, RNA therapeutics are too large, too charged, and/or too hydrophilic to passively diffuse across the cellular membrane and instead are taken up into cells by endocytosis. However, endosomes are also composed of a lipid bilayer barrier that results in endosomal capture and retention of 99% of RNA therapeutics with 1% or less entering the cytoplasm. Although this very low level of endosomal escape has proven sufficient for liver and some CNS disorders, it is insufficient for the vast majority of extra-hepatic diseases. Unfortunately, there are currently no acceptable solutions to the endosomal escape problem. Consequently, before RNA therapeutics can be used to treat widespread human disease, the rate-limiting delivery problem of endosomal escape must be solved in a nontoxic manner."

Although more than 200 missense and null TP53 mutations are well established as disease-causing, little is known about the pathogenicity and cancer risks associated with small in-frame deletions. This leads to challenges in variant classification and subsequent difficulty making a molecular diagnosis. We report the genetic testing process for a pediatric patient diagnosed with an undifferentiated high-grade brain tumor following his mother's diagnosis of early-onset bilateral breast cancer. Sequential testing revealed that both harbored a heterozygous three-nucleotide deletion in exon 7 of TP53 (c.764_766delTCA; I255del), which was classified as a variant of uncertain significance. Because the maternal family history was void of any other LFS spectrum tumors, additional information was needed to effectively classify the variant. Targeted TP53 testing of the patient's maternal grandparents confirmed that neither carried the variant; this new de novo data upgraded the variant classification to likely pathogenic. To assess the impact of this mutation on the encoded p53 protein, additional in vitro analyses were performed. Structural modeling predicted that the deletion of isoleucine at codon 255 would disrupt the architecture of the DNA-binding domain, suggesting that it might negatively impact p53 function. Consistent with this notion, the I255del mutant protein exhibited significantly impaired transcriptional activity and greatly reduced growth suppressive properties, similar to more well-characterized LFS-associated p53 mutants. This report illustrates the importance of seeking additional evidence to assign proper pathogenicity classification, which enables optimal genetic counseling and medical management of individuals with LFS and their at-risk relatives."

These mutations have previously been shown to affect the general accuracy of translational termination. We find that among four nonsense suppressor ribosomal mutations tested, one (a ribosomal protein mutation) enhanced the efficiency of the Tyl frameshifting, another (an rRNA mutation) reduced frameshifting, and two others (another ribosomal protein mutation and another rRNA mutation) had no effect. Three antisuppressor rRNA mutations all reduced Tyl frameshifting; however the antisuppressor mutation in the ribosomal protein did not show any effect. Among nonribosomal mutations, the allosuppressor protein phosphatase mutation enhanced Tyl frameshifting, whereas the partially inactive prion form of the release factor eRF3 caused a slight decrease, if any effect. A mutant form of the other release factor, eRF1, also had no effect on frameshifting. Our data suggest that Ty frameshifting is under the control of the cellular translational machinery. Surprisingly we find that translational suppressors can affect Ty frameshifting in either direction, whereas antisuppressors have either no effect or cause a decrease."

However, it was not until World War II when two forms of viral hepatitis were clearly differentiated. After the discovery of Australia antigen and its association with hepatitis B, similar methodologies were used to find the hepatitis A virus. The virus was ultimately identified when investigators changed the focus of their search from serum to feces and applied appropriate technology."
Definition of an efficient synthetic poly(A) site.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.7.1019,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/7/1019,3,7,07/01/1989,1019,1025,"['N Levitt', 'D Briggs', 'A Gil', 'N J Proudfoot']","['Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, UK.']","We constructed and analyzed a synthetic poly(A) (SPA) site that was based on the highly efficient poly(A) signal of the rabbit beta-globin gene. By use of the SPA, we demonstrate that the minimum sequences required for efficient polyadenylation are the AATAAA sequence and a GT/T-rich sequence with the correct spacing of 22-23 nucleotides between them. When placed downstream of the poly(A) site of the human alpha 2-globin gene, the SPA is used exclusively. We predict that the SPA, with its more extensive GT/T-rich sequence, is a more efficient poly(A) site than alpha-globin. Also, we compared the use of the SPA when it is placed either in the exon 3 or intron 2 of the rabbit beta-globin gene. When in the exonic position, SPA is used 10-fold more than the regular poly(A) site of rabbit beta-globin. In contrast, when it is in the intronic location, no detectable use of SPA is observed; however, the deletion of the donor site of intron 2 reactivates the intronic positioned SPA. These results indicate that the splicing of intron 2 in the rabbit beta-globin gene occurs ahead of polyadenylation and have important implications for termination of transcription. Polyadenylation, although required for termination of transcription, is not sufficient; therefore, additional termination signals for RNA polymerase II must exist."
Restoring Movement in Paralysis with a Bioelectronic Neural Bypass Approach: Current State and Future Directions,Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med,,2157-1422,10.1101/cshperspect.a034306,http://perspectivesinmedicine.cshlp.org/content/9/11/a034306,9,11,11/01/2019,a034306,,['Chad E.

New bioelectronic methods are being developed to monitor and modulate neural activity directly. The therapeutic benefit of these approaches has been validated in recent clinical studies in various conditions, including paralysis. By using decoding and modulation strategies together, it is possible to restore lost function to those living with paralysis and other debilitating conditions by interpreting and rerouting signals around the affected portion of the nervous system. This, in effect, creates a bioelectronic “neural bypass” to serve the function of the damaged/degenerated network. By learning the language of neurons and using neural interface technology to tap into critical networks, new approaches to repairing or restoring function in areas impacted by disease or injury may become a reality."
The limb deformity gene is required for apical ectodermal ridge differentiation and anteroposterior limb pattern formation.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.10.1481,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/10/1481,3,10,10/01/1989,1481,1492,"['R Zeller', 'L Jackson-Grusby', 'P Leder']","['Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']","To gain insight into the role of the limb deformity (ld) gene in limb morphogenesis, we examined the morphologic details of early embryonic limb formation in the mutant ld/ld mouse. Initial morphological differences between wild-type and homozygous ld embryos are apparent during early gestational day 10, a time period during which anteroposterior limb morphogenesis occurs. As a result of a shortened anteroposterior axis, the mutant limb bud appears more pointed than its wild-type counterpart. In addition, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), a structure crucial to both proximodistal and anteroposterior limb development, fails to differentiate properly in mutant ld embryos. Consistent with these observations, molecular analysis of the limb promordia shows that the limb ectoderm contains a level of ld transcripts fivefold higher relative to its mesenchyme. Furthermore, expression of ld transcripts in other parts of the developing embryo and in primitive streak embryos (gestational day 7) suggests possible roles for this gene in the earliest determinative events of morphogenesis. These data lead us to conclude that ld gene products are required for both proper AER differentiation and anteroposterior pattern formation in limb mesenchyme."
Enhancers display constrained sequence flexibility and context-specific modulation of motif function,Genome Research,Genome Res.,1088-9051,1549-5469,10.1101/gr.277246.122,https://genome.cshlp.org/content/33/3/346,33,3,03/01/2023,346,358,"['Franziska Reiter', 'Bernardo P. de Almeida', 'Alexander Stark']","['Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna BioCenter, Campus-Vienna-BioCenter 1, 1030 Vienna, Austria', 'Vienna BioCenter PhD Program, Doctoral School of the University of Vienna and Medical University of Vienna, 1030 Vienna, Austria', 'Medical University of Vienna, Vienna BioCenter, 1030 Vienna, Austria']","The information about when and where each gene is to be expressed is mainly encoded in the DNA sequence of enhancers, sequence elements that comprise binding sites (motifs) for different transcription factors (TFs). Most of the research on enhancer sequences has been focused on TF motif presence, whereas the enhancer syntax, that is, the flexibility of important motif positions and how the sequence context modulates the activity of TF motifs, remains poorly understood. Here, we explore the rules of enhancer syntax by a two-pronged approach in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells: we (1) replace important TF motifs by all possible 65,536 eight-nucleotide-long sequences and (2) paste eight important TF motif types into 763 positions within 496 enhancers. These complementary strategies reveal that enhancers display constrained sequence flexibility and the context-specific modulation of motif function. Important motifs can be functionally replaced by hundreds of sequences constituting several distinct motif types, but these are only a fraction of all possible sequences and motif types. Moreover, TF motifs contribute with different intrinsic strengths that are strongly modulated by the enhancer sequence context (the flanking sequence, the presence and diversity of other motif types, and the distance between motifs), such that not all motif types can work in all positions. The context-specific modulation of motif function is also a hallmark of human enhancers, as we demonstrate experimentally. Overall, these two general principles of enhancer sequences are important to understand and predict enhancer function during development, evolution, and in disease."

The results show that, in general, most populations have the same set of the most frequent alleles at these loci. Hypothetical ancestral haplotypes, reconstructed on the basis of these alleles and their close derivatives, are shared by multiple populations across racial and geographical boundaries. A network of the observed haplotypes is characterized by a lack of clustering of geographically proximal populations. In spite of this, few distinct clusters of closely related populations emerged in the network, which are associated with population-specific alleles. A tree based on allele frequencies also shows similar results. Lack of haplotypic structure associated with the presumed ancestral haplotypes consisting of individuals from almost all populations indicate a recent common ancestry and/or extensive male migration during human evolutionary history. The convergent nature of microsatellite mutation confounds population relationships. Optimum resolution of Y chromosome evolution will require the use of additional microsatellite loci and diallelic genetic markers with lower mutation rates."
A compensatory base change in human U2 snRNA can suppress a branch site mutation.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.10.1545,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/10/1545,3,10,10/01/1989,1545,1552,"['Y Zhuang', 'A M Weiner']","['Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']","We have developed an assay to test whether U2 snRNA can base-pair with the branch site during mammalian mRNA splicing. The beta 110 point mutation (GG----AG) within the first intron of human beta-globin generates a new 3' splice site that is preferentially used. We show here that use of the normal 3' splice site can be restored either by improving the match of a cryptic branch site to the branch site consensus or by introducing mutant U2 snRNAs with greater complementarity to the cryptic branch site. These data indicate that human U2 snRNA can form base pairs with the mRNA precursor; however, base pairing appears to be optional because some mammalian branch sites do not match the consensus."

The ability to manipulate and probe individual molecules or molecular complexes has led to a new, more refined understanding of the mechanical properties of the fundamental building blocks of the cell, and of the mechanism by which molecular machines function. The minimization and management of noise are the keys to building a high-resolution optical tweezers. The high degree of stability needed to observe angstrom motions of a biological system places rather stringent requirements on the environment in which the instrument operates. Specifically, environmental noise is a concern when it leads to differential movements of the optical trap relative to the second attachment point of the tether. In this article, we discuss what entails a quiet environment--what sources of noise are relevant and how they affect the instrument--and provide guidelines for choosing an appropriate location for a high-resolution instrument."

In this study we investigated the expression of neurotrophic factor genes after induction of LTDA in cultured cerebellar slices. LTDA was induced by application of quisqualate and monitored as a population response with a wedge recording technique. The levels of mRNA were quantified by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction. Quisqualate, at a dose and duration that reliably induced LTDA, elicited a significant and specific increase in BDNF mRNA with a peak at four hours after the application. By cell fractionation, the major source of BDNF mRNA increase was found to be in granule cells. In addition, a small but significant increase of transcripts with specific exon usage was observed in a Purkinje cell fraction. These results indicate that BDNF may be coinduced with LTDA and suggest that the slow and sustained increase of BDNF mRNA might play a role in later phases of synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum."

We recently devised a screening strategy based upon affinity-selection mass spectrometry and succeeded in identifying bioactive compounds for the noncoding RNA prototype, Xist. One such compound, termed X1, has drug-like properties and binds specifically to the RepA motif of Xist in vitro and in vivo. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis reveals that X1 changes the conformation of RepA in solution, thereby explaining the displacement of cognate interacting protein factors (PRC2 and SPEN) and inhibition of X-chromosome inactivation. In this Perspective, we discuss lessons learned from these proof-of-concept experiments and suggest that RNA can be systematically targeted by drug-like compounds to disrupt RNA structure and function."

Breaking the symmetry of neurons depends on cytoskeletal rearrangements. In particular, axon specification requires local dynamic instability of actin and stabilization of microtubules. The polarized cytoskeleton also provides the basis for selective trafficking and retention of cellular components in the future somatodendritic or axonal compartments. Hence, these mechanisms are not only essential to achieve neuronal polarization, but also to maintain it. Different extracellular and intracellular signals converge on the regulation of the cytoskeleton. Most notably, Rho GTPases, PI3K, Ena/VASP, cofilin and SAD kinases are major intracellular regulators of neuronal polarity. Analyzing polarity signals under physiological conditions will provide a better understanding of how neurons can be induced to repolarize under pathological conditions, i.e., to regenerate their axons after central nervous system (CNS) injury."
An adenovirus early region 4 gene product is required for induction of the infection-specific form of cellular E2F activity.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.7.1062,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/7/1062,3,7,07/01/1989,1062,1074,"['S Hardy', 'D A Engel', 'T Shenk']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biology, Princeton University, New Jersey 08544.']","E2F is a cellular, sequence-specific DNA-binding factor that binds to pairs of sites that occur upstream of the E1A and E2 early mRNA cap sites. During adenovirus infection, there is induction of a form of E2F that binds cooperatively to the pair of sites in the E2 control region. Production of the infection-specific E2F activity is dependent on early region 4 (E4), as extracts of cells infected with a mutant that lacks E4 did not contain this activity. Instead, two new forms of E2F were seen with the E4 mutant. Infection with mutant viruses unable to make E1A gene products produced the wild-type infection-specific E2F activity after a delay. Mutations in the E1B-55 kD-, E1B-21 kD-, E2-72 kD-, and E3-coding regions had no effect on production of infection-specific E2F. Analysis of cell lines confirmed the results obtained with mutant viruses. Cells that expressed E1A but not E4 genes (e.g., 293 cells) did not contain infection-specific E2F. Cell lines that expressed the E4 gene contained the activity. These observations demonstrate that E4 participates in the infection-induced change in E2F-binding activity. The data are consistent with E1A playing an indirect role in the process by mediating the efficient expression of E4 gene products which, in turn, induce the alteration in E2F activity."

Mutations that eliminate the Abd-B domain act as late embryonic lethals and result in transformations of posterior abdominal segments toward more anterior ones. The Abd-B domain gives rise to a minimum of five homeo-box-containing transcripts, 7.8, 4.7, 4.3, 3.7, and 3.3 kb in length. We examined the structure of the Abd-B domain by sequencing two Abd-B cDNA clones derived from the 4.3- and the 4.7-kb transcripts and the corresponding genomic DNA. The domain spans approximately 100 kb and contains at least eight exons. The 4.7- and 4.3-kb transcripts contain an open reading frame capable of encoding a 54-kD protein. A portion of the deduced protein-coding sequence common to all of the Abd-B transcripts was cloned into an expression vector. The resultant fusion protein then was used to derive a monoclonal antibody specific to Abd-B. By use of that antibody, we identified two embryonic Abd-B proteins, 54 and 36 kD and determined the sum of their segmental distribution by immunohistochemical analysis of whole-mounted embryos and immunofluorescent analysis of dissected embryonic nervous systems.

Some unfortunate patients are destined to deteriorate despite even newer and more effective agents because of the inability of these drugs to fully curb the inflammatory component of the disease. These patients require something more that might be capable of halting the disease process. Using high-intensity myeloablative chemotherapeutic agents, it is now possible to completely remove the peripheral immune system and replace it anew from autologous bone marrow–derived hematopoietic stem cells, purged of disease-causing MS cells.

Deletion analysis of the upstream promoter region of the H3 gene revealed several regions that are involved in both positive and negative control. DNase I footprinting, mobility shift, and methylation interference experiments reveal multiple sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that interact with at least five distinct regions within 200 bp upstream of the RNA initiation site. Extracts prepared from staged embryos revealed that the ability of the factors to bind their target sequences was regulated. Proteins bound at four different sites were detected only at stages when the H3 gene was active transcriptionally. In addition, three different forms of a CCAAT-binding protein also are regulated temporally. The activity of these protein(s), however, correlates inversely with the transcriptional activity of the gene. The TATA box and CCAAT sequences are all that is required for expression of low levels of H3 transcripts with the proper temporal pattern. This approach should be useful in understanding the mechanisms used to regulate temporal patterns of gene expression during early embryogenesis."

With successive blocks of practice responding to the same set of stimuli, both groups, including a subset of cerebellar patients with unilateral right hemisphere lesions, improved their response times.

Sequencing the first human genome as a haploid reference took nearly 10 years but now a full diploid human genome sequence can be accomplished in just a few days. NGS has also reduced the cost of generating sequence data and a plethora of sequence-based methods for probing a genome have emerged using NGS as the readout and have been applied to many species. NGS methods have also entered the medical realm and will see an increasing use in diagnosis and treatment. NGS has largely been driven by short-read generation (150 bp) but new platforms have emerged and are now capable of generating long multikilobase reads. These latter platforms enable reference-independent genome assemblies and long-range haplotype generation. Rapid DNA and RNA sequencing is now mainstream and will continue to have an increasing impact on biology and medicine."

In this report we examine the ability of the D. melanogaster hobo element to transpose in lepidopteran species. A Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper) and a Helicoverpa zea (corn earworm) embryonic cell line were found to be capable of supporting productive transposition of the hobo element as measured by a plasmid-based excision assay. Furthermore, hobo transposition was detected in H. zea embryos in a manner consistent with that seen for the cell line. In both cases, transposition/excision was found to be independent of vector-encoded transposase functions, indicating that endogenous genes are involved in hobo mobility. Finally, we demonstrate the stable insertion of the bacterial lacZ gene into the H. zea genome. These data demonstrate that hobo elements are capable of transgressing species boundaries and functioning in non-drosophilid cellular environments. More importantly, this represents the first description of a genetic transformation system for a lepidopteran species."

In situ hybridization of BAD2 demonstrates that stimuli that produce seizure, kindling, and long-term potentiation cause a rapid increase in BAD2 mRNA (within 0.5-1 hr after stimulation) that has, in each case, a distinctive pattern of expression in the brain. In these regions, the induction of a MAP kinase-specific phosphatase may provide a negative feedback control associated with long-term synaptic changes."

In this i-tRAP method, demethylases remove base methylations which are problematic for reverse transcription reaction, and β-elimination reaction specifically removes the 3′ end of adenine residue in uncharged tRNA. Subsequent TaqMan MGB qRT-PCR can distinguish between cDNA of charged tRNA and uncharged tRNA. By using this method, we revealed that the charging ratio of tRNA Gln (CUG) was changed in response to amino acid starvation and also the charging ratio of tRNA Gln (CUG) in senescent cells was lower than in young cells under starvation conditions. i-tRAP can be applicable to the quantification of the charging ratio of various tRNAs, and provides a simple and convenient method for analyzing tRNA charging."

Panel testing, in particular, can be problematic because each of the many genes being sequenced might represent a plausible explanation for a given case. We performed targeted gene panel analysis of 43 established neuromuscular disease genes in a patient with congenital fiber-type disproportion (CFTD) and fatal infantile cardiomyopathy. Initial review of variants identified changes in four genes that could be considered relevant candidates to cause this child's disease. Further analysis revealed that two of these are likely benign, but a homozygous frameshift variant in the myosin light chain 2 gene, MYL2 , and a heterozygous nonsense mutation in the nebulin gene, NEB , met criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic or pathogenic. Recessive MYL2 mutations are a rare cause of CFTD associated with both skeletal and cardiomyopathy, whereas recessive NEB mutations cause nemaline myopathy. Although the proband's phenotype is likely largely explained by the MYL2 variant, the heterozygous pathogenic NEB variant cannot be ruled out as a contributing factor.

Over the last decade, a wide range of technologies have emerged for regulating cellular activity using optical, chemical, and, more recently, electromagnetic modalities. Electromagnetic fields can freely penetrate cells and tissue and their energy can be absorbed by metal particles. When released, the absorbed energy can in turn gate endogenous or engineered receptors and ion channels to regulate cell activity. In this manner, electromagnetic fields acting on external nanoparticles have been used to exert mechanical forces on cell membranes and organelles to generate heat and interact with thermally activated proteins or to induce receptor aggregation and intracellular signaling. More recently, technologies using genetically encoded nanoparticles composed of the iron storage protein, ferritin, have been used for targeted, temporal control of cell activity in vitro and in vivo. These tools provide a means for noninvasively modulating gene expression, intracellular organelles, such as endosomes, and whole-cell activity both in vitro and in freely moving animals. The use of magnetic fields interacting with external or genetically encoded nanoparticles thus provides a rapid noninvasive means for regulating cell activity."

The generation of these SOs requires the activity of the achaete (ac) and scute (sc) genes. To investigate whether ac and sc also provide spatial information for the positioning of SOs, we have analyzed the patterns of expression of these genes in the wing imaginal disc around the time that SO precursors are being specified. We find that expression coincides with and is restricted to areas of the disc where these precursors are known to be located. In the loss-of-function sc mutant, sc RNA is depleted in a single area located in the region where the precursor for the suppressed macrochaeta should be found. Moreover, some, and probably all, SOs require expression of these genes to reach the earliest detectable differentiated state. These and other results presented here, together with the finding that expansion of the areas of ac and/or sc expression causes the development of ectopic SOs, indicate that ac and sc promote the determination of SO precursors and delimit the regions of the imaginal discs where they can develop."

Current information suggests that the paracellular barrier is most usefully modeled as having two physiologic components: a system of charge-selective small pores, 4 Å in radius, and a second pathway created by larger discontinuities in the barrier, lacking charge or size discrimination. The first pathway is influenced by claudin expression patterns and the second is likely controlled by different proteins and signals. Recent information on claudin function and disease-causing mutations have led to a more complete understanding of their role in barrier formation, but progress is impeded by lack of high resolution structural information."

How they do it is little understood. Tethered flies at the flight simulator ""navigate"" in an artificial visual landscape without forward movement. They can return to a previously held orientation if the panorama provides a singularity (landmark) as reference. Surprisingly, in a regularly striped drum without singularities, they can use a temporal cue instead. In this experiment the arena is illuminated with only one color that is either green or blue. The arena is virtually divided into four quadrants. Whenever a quadrant boundary moves past an arbitrary point, the color of the arena light changes. When a fly is heated with one color it acquires a preference for the other one. Subsequently, it avoids the borders toward the potentially 'hot' quadrants even without touching them. The only way to achieve this is by turn integration, that is, by adding and subtracting all the turns it performs once it crosses the border. The color switch defining the border crossing resets the turn integrator, using the orientation of the arena at this moment as reference. In contrast, landmarks or, if it were available, the skylight compass enable the fly to establish by pattern learning any orientation as a reference. If the reference orientation coincides with the desired orientation, that is, if the animal stores the pattern while being oriented toward the goal, it can maintain its orientation without recourse to turn integration (which may be error prone)."

We believe HF development during puberty is critical to negative overgeneralization, a common feature of anxiety disorders. To investigate this claim, we examined the relationship between mnemonic generalization and a cross-sectional pubertal maturity index (PMI) derived from partial least squares correlation (PLSC) analyses of subfield volumes and structural connectivity from T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted scans, respectively. Participants aged 9–14 yr, from clinical and community sources, performed a recognition task with emotionally valent (positive, negative, and neutral) images. HF volumetric PMI was positively associated with generalization for negative images. Hippocampal–medial prefrontal cortex connectivity PMI evidenced a behavioral relationship similar to that of the HF volumetric approach. These findings reflect a novel developmentally related balance between generalization behavior supported by the hippocampus and its connections with other regions, with maturational differences in this balance potentially contributing to negative overgeneralization during peripuberty."

Among these, the most well characterized are RNA editing catalytic complexes (RECCs) that catalyze the guide RNA (gRNA)-specified insertion and deletion of uridines during mitochondrial mRNA maturation. This post-transcriptional resequencing of mitochondrial mRNAs can be extensive, involving dozens of different gRNAs and hundreds of editing sites with most of the mature mRNA sequences resulting from the editing process. Proper coordination of the editing with the cognate gRNAs is attributed to RNA editing substrate-binding complexes (RESCs), which are also required for RNA editing. Although the precise mechanism of RESC function is less well understood, their affinity for binding both editing substrates and products suggests that these complexes may provide a scaffold for RECC catalytic processing. KRGG1 has been shown to bind RNAs, and although affinity purification co-isolates RESC complexes, its role in RNA editing remains uncertain. We show here that KRGG1 is essential in BF parasites and required for normal editing. KRGG1 repression results in reduced amounts of edited A6 mRNA and increased amounts of edited ND8 mRNA. Sequence and structure analysis of KRGG1 identified a region of homology with RESC6, and both proteins have predicted tandem helical repeats that resemble ARM/HEAT motifs. The ARM/HEAT-like region is critical for function as exclusive expression of mutated KRGG1 results in growth inhibition and disruption of KRGG1 association with RESCs. These results indicate that KRGG1 is critical for RNA editing and its specific function is associated with RESC activity."

An optimal treatment is usually based on a personalized approach determined by an individual patient’s prognosis and treatment risks. Biomarkers that can predict disability progression, monitor ongoing disease activity, and assess treatment response are integral in making important decisions regarding MS treatment. This review describes MS biomarkers that are currently being used in clinical practice; it also reviews and consolidates published findings from clinically relevant potential MS biomarkers in recent years. The work also discusses the challenges of validating and application of biomarkers in MS clinical practice."

This study presents seven patients with arginase 1 deficiency from six different families, all with an initial diagnosis of complicated HSP. We evaluated the clinical data of seven patients belonging to six independent families who were diagnosed with hyperargininemia in a neurogenetics outpatient clinic. All patients had lower limb spasticity and six had global developmental delay. Five individuals had intellectual disability and two had epilepsy. Psychiatric abnormalities were seen in two patients. In two participants of this study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed thinning of the corpus callosum. Molecular diagnosis was made by whole-exome sequencing. All variants were present in homozygosis; we identified two novel missense variants, one novel frameshift variant, and one previously published missense variant. A clinical diagnosis of early-onset complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia was made in all patients. Two patients were initially suspected of having SPG11 because of thinning of the corpus callosum. As argininemia may present with a highly penetrant phenotype of spastic paraplegia associated with additional symptoms, this disease may represent a specific entity among the complicated HSPs."

Further investigation, using genome sequencing, identified a novel ∼7.5-kb deletion (Chr 4:670,405–677,862del) encompassing the ATP5ME gene, part of the 5′ UTR of MYL5 , and a 378-bp (Chr 4:670,405–670,782) region from the 3′ UTR of PDE6B in the affected twins and their unaffected mother. Both variants segregated with disease in the family. Analysis of the relative expression of PDE6B , in peripheral blood cells, also revealed a significantly lower level of PDE6B transcript in affected siblings compared to a normal control. PDE6B is associated with recessive rod–cone degeneration and autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness. Ophthalmic evaluation of these patients showed night blindness, fundus abnormalities, and peripheral vision loss, which are consistent with PDE6B -associated recessive retinal degeneration. These findings suggest that the loss of PDE6B transcript resulting from the compound heterozygous pathogenic variants is the underlying cause of recessive rod–cone degeneration in the study family."

This review will focus on the planarian flatworm as a powerful model system for studying the role of Ca 2+ signals in regeneration. These invertebrate animals display an astounding innate regenerative capacity capable of regenerating complete organisms from tiny, excised fragments. New knowledge and methodological capabilities in this system highlight the potential for studying the role of Ca 2+ signaling at multiple stages of the regenerative blueprint that controls stem cell behavior in vivo."

Here, we design a heterogeneous graph neural network model, CAME, to learn aligned and interpretable cell and gene embeddings for cross-species cell-type assignment and gene module extraction from scRNA-seq data. CAME achieves significant improvements in cell-type characterization across distant species owing to the utilization of non-one-to-one homologous gene mapping ignored by early methods. Our large-scale benchmarking study shows that CAME significantly outperforms five classical methods in terms of cell-type assignment and model robustness to insufficiency and inconsistency of sequencing depths. CAME can transfer the major cell types and interneuron subtypes of human brains to mouse and discover shared cell-type-specific functions in homologous gene modules. CAME can align the trajectories of human and macaque spermatogenesis and reveal their conservative expression dynamics. In short, CAME can make accurate cross-species cell-type assignments even for nonmodel species and uncover shared and divergent characteristics between two species from scRNA-seq data."

Here, we report a patient with a missense variant of unknown significance predicted to modify residue 308 in the anticodon binding domain of YARS1 (p.Asp308Tyr). Interestingly, p.Asp308Tyr is associated with proximal-predominant motor neuropathy, which has not been reported in patients with pathogenic YARS1 variants. We demonstrate that this allele causes a loss-of-function effect in yeast complementation assays when modeled in YARS1 and the yeast ortholog TYS1 ; structural modeling of this variant further supports a loss-of-function effect. Taken together, this study raises the possibility that certain YARS1 variants cause proximal-prominent motor neuropathy and indicates that patients with this phenotype should be screened for genetic lesions in YARS1 ."

As reported previously, K-252a and staurosporine blocked LTP induction when applied before, during, and after high-frequency stimulation (HFS). In contrast, K-252a did not block LTP when applied only before and during HFS and washed out immediately after HFS. K-252a and staurosporine both attenuated LTP magnitude when applied immediately after or as late as 5 min after HFS. However, K-252a applications beginning 30-45 min after HFS did not affect LTP expression significantly. K-252a had no detectable effect on isolated N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated EPSPs but significantly inhibited the in situ phosphorylation of specific hippocampal proteins (synapsin I, MARCKS, and B-50). In addition, K-252a attenuated 4 beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu)-enhanced synaptic transmission. Our results indicate that there is a critical period of protein kinase activity required for LTP induction that extends for approximately 20 min after HFS. In addition, our results suggest that protein kinase activity during and immediately after HFS is not sufficient for LTP induction. These results provide new information about the mechanisms that underlie LTP induction and expression and provide evidence for persistent and/or Ca(2+)-independent protein kinase activity involvement in LTP."

Learning of the association was measured by a bird's fear and avoidance responses. Birds exposed to paired song and shock were compared to yoked controls exposed to each stimulus alone or to both unpaired. Additional groups examined the effects of attention and stress, and of the novelty of the stimulus situation. In situ hybridization analysis of brain sections revealed an enhancement of ZENK expression in birds learning the association between song and shock above levels induced by song alone or yoked-unpaired song and shock. This effect was specifically seen in the caudomedial auditory telencephalon (NCM-HVCM). A comparison of the several control groups indicated that novelty of the song stimulus or of its pairing with shock were the main variables that predicted ZENK levels in NCM-HVCM. These observations are compatible with ZENK playing a role in the formation of song perceptual memories."
Matching queried single-cell open-chromatin profiles to large pools of single-cell transcriptomes and epigenomes for reference supported analysis,Genome Research,Genome Res.,1088-9051,1549-5469,10.1101/gr.277015.122,https://genome.cshlp.org/content/33/2/218,33,2,02/01/2023,218,231,"['Shreya Mishra', 'Neetesh Pandey', 'Smriti Chawla', 'Madhu Sharma', 'Omkar Chandra', 'Indra Prakash Jha', 'Debarka SenGupta', 'Kedar Nath Natarajan', 'Vibhor Kumar']","['Department for Computational Biology, IIIT Delhi 110020, India', 'Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane 4001, Australia', 'DTU Bioengineering, Technical University of Denmark, DK-2800 Kgs.

Matching a single-cell epigenome profile to a large pool of reference cells remains a major challenge. Here, we present scEpiSearch, which enables searching, comparison, and independent classification of single-cell open-chromatin profiles against a large reference of single-cell expression and open-chromatin data sets. Across performance benchmarks, scEpiSearch outperformed multiple methods in accuracy of search and low-dimensional coembedding of single-cell profiles, irrespective of platforms and species. Here we also demonstrate the unconventional utilities of scEpiSearch by applying it on single-cell epigenome profiles of K562 cells and samples from patients with acute leukaemia to reveal different aspects of their heterogeneity, multipotent behavior, and dedifferentiated states. Applying scEpiSearch on our single-cell open-chromatin profiles from embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we identified ESC subpopulations with more activity and poising for endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response. Thus, scEpiSearch solves the nontrivial problem of amalgamating information from a large pool of single cells to identify and study the regulatory states of cells using their single-cell epigenomes."

It refers especially to the tropical food species but it will also work for temperate species. The tropical food species of Dioscorea grow in warm, sunny climates with temperatures between 25ºC and 30ºC. Short days of 10-11 h result in tuber formation, while days longer than 12 h favor vine growth. Yams require deep, loose, textured loamy soil that is rich in organic matter. They are best planted at the beginning of the rainy season. Mulch around the planted sets protects them from excessive heat and desiccation, especially in areas with hot temperatures and dry weather. It also adds organic matter to the soil, prevents soil erosion, preserves water in the soil, and increases microbial activity in the soil. Yams do not tolerate waterlogged conditions. It is important to stake the plants to allow full exposure of their leaves to light for photosynthetic activity and to reduce disease."

DNA blot analysis indicates that the Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains four to five phytochrome-related gene sequences. We have isolated and sequenced cDNA clones corresponding to three of these genes and have deduced the amino acid sequence of the full-length polypeptide encoded in each case. One of these proteins (phyA) shows 65-80% amino acid sequence identity with the major, etiolated-tissue phytochrome apoproteins described previously in other plant species. The other two polypeptides (phyB and phyC) are unique in that they have low sequence identity (approximately 50%) with each other, with phyA, and with all previously described phytochromes. The phyA, phyB, and phyC proteins are of similar molecular mass, have related hydropathic profiles, and contain a conserved chromophore attachment region. However, the sequence comparison data indicate that the three phy genes diverged early in plant evolution, well before the divergence of the two major groups of angiosperms, the monocots and dicots. The steady-state level of the phyA transcript is high in dark-grown A. thaliana seedlings and is down-regulated by light. In contrast, the phyB and phyC transcripts are present at lower levels and are not strongly light-regulated. These findings indicate that the red/far light-responsive phytochrome photoreceptor system in A. thaliana, and perhaps in all higher plants, consists of a family of chromoproteins that are heterogeneous in structure and regulation."

Fourteen Fugu G alpha genes were identified of the 16 genes characterized previously in mammals, including Fugu genes from the four classes of alpha subunits Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12. Fugu and mammalian G alpha coding sequences are highly homologous, and the intron/exon structure of the fish and mammalian orthologs is identical throughout the coding regions. A novel G alpha gene, G alpha p1, was also identified in Fugu rubripes and two other species of puffer fish. The complete sequence of Gnaz and the tandemly duplicated genes Gnai2 and Gnat1 were obtained from a Fugu genomic cosmid library. Introns in the puffer fish G alpha genes lacked repeat DNA sequences, other than simple sequence length repeats, and most introns were significantly shorter in Fugu than in mammalian orthologs. The compact genome of puffer fish provides a unique vertebrate model for characterizing multigene families and identifying novel genes directly from genomic DNA by PCR amplification with degenerate primers. The fact that Fugu encodes most, if not all, of the G protein alpha subunits identified in mammals strongly supports Fugu as a model organism for vertebrate genome research."

Because activated T cells up-regulate high-affinity IL-2R and IL-2 is used to grow activated T cells in vitro, daclizumab was envisioned to selectively inhibit activated T cells. However, the mechanism of action (MOA) of daclizumab is surprisingly broad and it includes many unanticipated effects on innate immunity. Specifically, daclizumab modulates the development of innate lymphoid cells, leading to expansion of immunoregulatory CD56 bright natural killer (NK) cells. Activated CD56 bright NK cells migrate to the intrathecal compartment in multiple sclerosis (MS) and regulate autoreactive T cells via cytotoxicity. Finally, daclizumab also restricts initial steps of T-cell activation by blocking trans -presentation of IL-2 by dendritic cells to antigen-specific T cells. In conclusion, daclizumab has complex immunomodulatory effects with resultant inhibition of central nervous system inflammation in MS."

Ten CBF images were acquired in 16 normal women as they made possible/impossible and old/new recognition decisions about previously studied (old) and nonstudied (new) structurally possible and impossible objects. As reported previously, object decisions for familiar possible objects were associated with increased CBF in the vicinity of the left inferior temporal and fusiform gyri and recognition memory for familiar possible objects was associated with increased CBF in the vicinity of the right hippocampus. In this report, we provide more extensive analyses of the roles of the inferior temporal cortex, the hippocampus, the parahippocampus, and the pulvinar in encoding and retrieval operations. Additionally, patterns of CBF increases and decreases provide information regarding the neural structures involved in implicit and explicit memory."

Today, cassava is grown in the tropics of South America, Africa, and Asia with an estimated 800 million people relying on it as a staple source of calories. In parts of sub-Saharan Africa, cassava is particularly crucial for food security. Cassava root starch also has use in the pharmaceutical, textile, paper, and biofuel industries. Cassava has seen strong demand since 2000 and production has increased consistently year-over-year, but potential yields are hampered by susceptibility to biotic and abiotic stresses. In particular, bacterial and viral diseases can cause severe yield losses. Of note are cassava bacterial blight (CBB), cassava mosaic disease (CMD), and cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), all of which can cause catastrophic losses for growers. In this article, we provide an overview of the major microbial diseases of cassava, discuss current and potential future efforts to engineer new sources of resistance, and conclude with a discussion of the regulatory hurdles that face biotechnology."

Loss of the wild-type allele in > 90% of tumors from patients with inherited BRCA1 mutations indicates tumor suppressive function. The low incidence of somatic mutations suggests that BRCA1 inactivation in sporadic tumors occurs by alternative mechanisms, such as interstitial chromosomal deletion or reduced transcription. To identify possible features of the BRCA1 genomic region that may contribute to chromosomal instability as well as potential transcriptional regulatory elements, a 117,143-bp DNA sequence encompassing BRCA1 was obtained by random sequencing of four cosmids identified from a human chromosome 17 specific library. The 24 exons of BRCA1 span an 81-kb region that has an unusually high density of Alu repetitive DNA (41.5%), but relatively low density (4.8%) of other repetitive sequences. BRCA1 intron lengths range in size from 403 bp to 9.2 kb and contain the intragenic microsatellite markers D17S1323, D17S1322, and D17S855, which localize to introns 12, 19, and 20, respectively. In addition to BRCA1, the contig contains two complete genes: Rho7, a member of the rho family of GTP binding proteins, and VAT1, an abundant membrane protein of cholinergic synaptic vesicles.

DNA sequencing of mts1 revealed an open reading frame containing information for a peptide of 101 amino acids, and the amino acid sequence suggested that the mts1 protein was identical to the previously isolated Ca2+-binding mouse protein (Jackson-Grusby et al. 1987; Goto et al. 1988).

Import rate of matrix proteins was significantly decreased in the patient-derived fibroblasts. Binding of Pex26-F51L to the AAA ATPase peroxins, Pex1 and Pex6, is severely impaired and affects peroxisome assembly. Moreover, Pex26 in the patient's fibroblasts is reduced to ∼30% of the control, suggesting that Pex26-F51L is unstable in cells. In the patient's fibroblasts, peroxisome-targeting signal 1 (PTS1) proteins, PTS2 protein 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, and catalase are present in a punctate staining pattern at 37°C and in a diffuse pattern at 42°C, suggesting that these matrix proteins are not imported to peroxisomes in a temperature-sensitive manner. Analysis of peroxisomal metabolism in the patient's fibroblasts showed that the level of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (C22:6n-3) in ether phospholipids is decreased, whereas other lipid metabolism, including peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation, is normal.

This analysis revealed a clonal PLCB4 mutation in the melanocytosis, confirming that this is indeed a neoplastic condition and explaining why it predisposes to UM. This mutation was present in 100% of analyzed UM cells, indicating that a PLCB4 -mutant cell gave rise to the UM. The earliest aberrations specific to the tumor were loss of Chromosomes 1p, 3, and 9p, which were present in virtually all tumor cells. A mutation in BAP1 arose later on the other copy of Chromosome 3 in a tumor subclone, followed by a gain of Chromosome 8q. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the well-known clinical association between ocular melanocytosis and UM by showing that this predisposing condition introduces the first “hit” and thereby increases the stochastic likelihood of acquiring further aberrations leading to UM."

The binding of some substrates also results in a substrate-dependent conformational change in the enzymatic RNA, as evidenced by the appearance of an M1 RNA intramolecular cross-link. The identification of the cross-links between M1 RNA and product indicate that they are shared with only one of the three cross-linked E-S complexes that were identified, an indication of noncompetitive inhibition by the product.

Here we will explore the role of chromosomal asymmetry and the presence of “new” and “old” poles that result from the cytokinesis of rod-shaped cells in establishing bipolar and monopolar protein localization patterns.

However, the TADs obtained by different methods vary greatly, which makes the accurate determination of TADs a challenging issue and hinders subsequent biological analyses about their organization and functions. Obvious inconsistencies among the TADs identified by different methods indeed make the statistical and biological properties of TADs overly depend on the chosen method rather than on the data. To this end, we use the consensus structural information captured by these methods to define the TAD separation landscape for decoding the consensus domain organization of the 3D genome. We show that the TAD separation landscape could be used to compare domain boundaries across multiple cell types for discovering conserved and divergent topological structures, decipher three types of boundary regions with diverse biological features, and identify consensus TADs (ConsTADs).

Here, we describe a standardized experimental setup that allows the analysis of larval aversive-odor–taste learning and memory. This is a Pavlovian learning experiment with a single training trial in which larvae are presented with two specific odors in succession, one odor together with salt at a high concentration that is harmful to the larva. In the subsequent test, the trained larvae then show avoidance of the salt-paired odor and spend more time near the unpaired odor. To rule out nonassociative effects (such as naive preferences for odors, exposure, or handling effects), two independent groups of larvae are reciprocally trained. Subsequently, the average of the two individual preference values is determined and quantified as a Performance Index (PI), which assigns a numerical value to the larvae's shown behavioral change."

Although the macaque major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region shares most features with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, macaques have an expanded repertoire of MHC class I genes. Although a chimera of two rhesus macaque MHC haplotypes was first published in 2004, the structural diversity of MHC genomic organization in macaques remains poorly understood owing to a lack of adequate genomic reference sequences. We used ultralong Oxford Nanopore and high-accuracy Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi sequences to fully assemble the ∼5.2-Mb M3 haplotype of an MHC-homozygous, Mauritian-origin cynomolgus macaque ( Macaca fascicularis ). The MHC homozygosity allowed us to assemble a single MHC haplotype unambiguously and avoid chimeric assemblies that hampered previous efforts to characterize this exceptionally complex genomic region in macaques. The high quality of this new assembly is exemplified by the identification of an extended cluster of six Mafa-AG genes that contains a recent duplication with a highly similar ∼48.5-kb block of sequence. The MHC class II region of this M3 haplotype is similar to the previously sequenced rhesus macaque haplotype and HLA class II haplotypes. The MHC class I region, in contrast, contains 13 MHC - B genes, four MHC - A genes, and three MHC - E genes (vs. 19 MHC - B , two MHC - A , and one MHC - E in the previously sequenced haplotype). These results provide an unambiguously assembled single contiguous cynomolgus macaque MHC haplotype with fully curated gene annotations that will inform infectious disease and transplantation research."

Here, we review what is known about how PTEN variants impact molecular function and, consequently, cellular phenotype. In particular, we highlight eight informative “sentinel variants” that abrogate distinct molecular functions of PTEN.

In both cases, microtubule-based systems help to shape the cell by breaking symmetry, providing endogenous spatial cues to position these sites. The plus ends of dynamic microtubules deliver polarity factors to the cell tips, leading to local activation of the GTPase cdc42p and the actin assembly machinery. Microtubule bundles contribute to positioning the division plane through the nucleus and the cytokinesis factor mid1p. Recent advances illustrate how the spatial and temporal regulation of cell polarization integrates many elements, including historical landmarks, positive and negative controls, and competition between pathways."

This is a dynamic process in which increasing concentrations and durations of exposure to SHH generate neurons with successively more ventral identities. Interactions between the receiving cells and the graded signal underpin the mechanism of SHH action. In particular, negative feedback, involving proteins transcriptionally induced or repressed by SHH signaling, plays an essential role in shaping the graded readout. On one hand, negative feedback controls, in a noncell-autonomous manner, the distribution of SHH across the field of receiving cells. On the other, it acts cell-autonomously to convert different concentrations of SHH into distinct durations of intracellular signal transduction. Together, these mechanisms exemplify a strategy for morphogen interpretation, which we have termed temporal adaptation that relies on the continuous processing and refinement of the cellular response to the graded signal."

Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been implicated in disease development, notably cancer. It is therefore important to develop genome-wide DNA methylation profiling technology. In this article, I describe a bisulfite methylation profiling (BiMP) method for assessing DNA methylation patterns. Treatment of DNA with sodium bisulfite converts unmethylated cytosine to uracil, whereas 5-methylcytosine is not converted. During subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, uracil amplifies as thymine, whereas 5-methylcytosine amplifies as cytosine, thereby creating C-to-T transitions. Although single base detection of DNA methylation patterns provided by bisulfite conversion is clearly advantageous, there are inherent challenges associated with this approach. Successful conversion requires relatively high temperatures (50°C-60°C) and low pH (5.2), both of which may result in a high degree of DNA fragmentation. Also, whole genome amplification methods established for genomic DNA have resulted in poor reproducibility when applied to bisulfite-converted DNA. The protocol described here mitigates these adverse effects and provides bisulfite-converted DNA suitable for genome-wide DNA methylation profiling using array-based analysis platforms."

However, the relatively large size of fluorescent fusion proteins can limit the utility of this approach, and sometimes the tag can render the protein of interest nonfunctional. Small genetic tagging with tetracysteine (TC) and subsequent labeling with membrane-permeable biarsenical dyes can overcome these limitations. This protocol describes the method to detect TC-tagged proteins by biarsenical labeling in live cells. A small amino acid tag containing four cysteines ( CC PG CC ) is introduced to a protein of interest. Cells expressing proteins with this tag are then treated with membrane-permeable dyes (FlAsH-EDT 2 or ReAsH-EDT 2 ), and the two arsenic groups of the dyes each bind to the two thiols in the TC motif. Once bound, FlAsH and ReAsH are converted to a fluorescent state (green and red fluorescence at excitation maxima of 508 and 593 nm, respectively) and can be detected by fluorescence microscopy. The method is particularly suitable for investigating protein dynamics that are difficult to study using a fluorescent protein tag. It also is a powerful method for visualizing trafficking of newly synthesized proteins in real time, because existing and newly synthesized pools of proteins can be labeled differentially with the red and green dyes. A method for labeling virally produced proteins is also presented."

This neuropsychological approach was employed to determine the extent to which multiple neural systems are compromised in aging and whether deterioration of one system correlates with that of another. The two tasks used in the present study were an odor-guided recognition memory task, for which different aspects of performance have been shown to be dependent on the integrity of the orbital prefrontal and perirhinal-entorhinal cortex, and the Morris water maze, for which performance depends on the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Rats were trained on the recognition memory task under minimal memory load and then challenged with longer memory delays and higher levels of inter-item interference. Considerable variation was observed in the performance of aged rats on acquisition of the recognition memory task, and unlike young rats, some aged rats could not acquire the task. Nevertheless, those aged rats who did acquire the cDNM task performed as well as young animals when the memory delay was extended and interference was elevated. In addition, consistent with previous findings, the performance of the same aged rats was highly variable in the Morris water maze task. Furthermore, although correlations between scores on the two tasks for individual aged rats were not reliable, only those aged rats that performed outside the performance range of young rats in the water maze were impaired on acquisition of the recognition memory task. This pattern of findings is consistent with age-related dysfunction in multiple subdivisions of the prefrontal cortex as well as the hippocampus and suggests that these brain regions may deteriorate in the same subgroup of aged rats."

The post-genome era has ignited strong interest in the noncoding genome and profiling epigenetic signatures genome-wide have been critical for the identification and characterization of noncoding gene-regulatory sequences in various cellular and developmental contexts. These technologies enable quantification of epigenetic marks through digital assessment of DNA fragments. With the capacity to probe both the DNA sequence and count DNA molecules at once with unparalleled throughput and sensitivity, deep sequencing has been especially transformative to the study of DNA methylation. This review will discuss advances in epigenome profiling with a particular focus on DNA methylation, highlighting how deep sequencing has generated new insights into the role of DNA methylation in gene regulation. Technical aspects of profiling DNA methylation, remaining challenges, and the future of DNA methylation sequencing are also described."

Such activity has also been reported to produce long-term depression of parallel fiber synaptic transmission. We have examined the relationship between these two events by combining patch clamp measurements of parallel fiber synaptic transmission with confocal microscopic imaging of the local calcium signals. We find that patterns of parallel fiber activity capable of evoking long-term depression invariably cause increases in Purkinje cell calcium concentration that are very spatially restricted. These results suggest that one function of the local dendritic calcium signals is to induce long-term depression of parallel fiber synapses.

In contrast, migratory mesenchymal cells have a front–rear axis of polarity. During development, mesenchymal cells convert to epithelia by coalescing into aggregates that undergo epithelial differentiation. Signaling networks and protein complexes comprising Rho family GTPases, polarity complexes (Crumbs, PAR, and Scribble), and their downstream effectors, including the cytoskeleton and the endocytic and exocytic vesicle trafficking pathways, together regulate the distributions of plasma membrane and cytoskeletal proteins between front–rear and apical–basal polarity. The challenge is to understand how these regulators and effectors are adapted to regulate symmetry breaking processes that generate cell polarities that are specialized for different cellular activities and functions."
Identity and geometry of a base triple in 16S rRNA determined by comparative sequence analysis and molecular modeling.,RNA,RNA,1355-8382,1469-9001,,http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/5/11/1430,5,11,11/01/1999,1430,1439,"['P Babin', 'M Dolan', 'P Wollenzien', 'R R Gutell']","['Department of Biochemistry, North Carolina State University, Raleigh 27695-7622, USA.']","Comparative sequence analysis complements experimental methods for the determination of RNA three-dimensional structure. This approach is based on the concept that different sequences within the same gene family form similar higher-order structures. The large number of rRNA sequences with sufficient variation, along with improved covariation algorithms, are providing us with the opportunity to identify new base triples in 16S rRNA. The three-dimensional conformations for one of our strongest candidates involving U121 (C124:G237) and/or U121 (U125:A236) (Escherichia coli sequence and numbering) are analyzed here with different molecular modeling tools. Molecular modeling shows that U121 interacts with C124 in the U121 (C124:G237) base triple. This arrangement maintains isomorphic structures for the three most frequent sequence motifs (approximately 93% of known bacterial and archaeal sequences), is consistent with chemical reactivity of U121 in E. coli ribosomes, and is geometrically favorable. Further, the restricted set of observed canonical (GU, AU, GC) base-pair types at positions 124:237 and 125:236 is consistent with the fact that the canonical base-pair sets (for both base pairs) that are not observed in nature prevent the formation of the 121 (124:237) base triple. The analysis described here serves as a general scheme for the prediction of specific secondary and tertiary structure base pairing where there is a network of correlated base changes."

We have utilized the human alpha- and beta-actin 3' UTRs as signals for colocalizing hammerhead ribozymes with a lacZtarget mRNA. Ribozyme and target genes containing matched or unmatched 3' UTRs were cotransfected into 12-day-old chicken embryonic myoblast and fibroblast (CEMF) cultures and assayed by in situ hybridization (ISH) using a dual label, antibody sandwich procedure, and dual fluorescence microscopy to monitor intracellular colocalization. Beta-galactosidase localization in transfectants was visualized by incubation with X-gal and also quantitated by an o-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) assay. We found that the percentage of colocalization using the matched alpha- or beta-actin 3' UTR (alpha-alpha or beta-beta) was enhanced approximately threefold relative to unmatched 3' UTRs. The increase in ribozyme-mediated inhibition of beta-galactosidase activity observed when matched 3' UTRs were used was consistent with the observed percentage of colocalization. These results represent the first direct demonstration that mRNA localization signals (zipcodes) can be utilized to enhance intracellular ribozyme efficacy."

The motif that is recognized by Erm methyltransferases is contained within helix 73 of 23S rRNA and the adjacent single-stranded region around A2058. An RNA transcript of 72 nt that displays this motif functions as an efficient substrate for the ErmE methyltransferase. Pools of degenerate RNAs were formed by doping 34-nt positions that extend over and beyond the putative Erm recognition motif within the 72-mer RNA. The RNAs were passed through a series of rounds of methylation with ErmE. After each round, RNAs were selected that had partially or completely lost their ability to be methylated. After several rounds of methylation/selection, 187 subclones were analyzed. Forty-three of the subclones contained substitutions at single sites, and these are confined to 12 nucleotide positions. These nucleotides, corresponding to A2051-A2060, C2611, and A2614 in 23S rRNA, presumably comprise the RNA recognition motif for ErmE methyltransferase. The structure formed by these nucleotides is highly conserved throughout bacterial rRNAs, and is proposed to constitute the motif that is recognized by all the Erm methyltransferases."

It is well accepted that the initial induction of LTP occurs in the postsynaptic cell, but the site of expression remains controversial. One prominent hypothesis is that LTP involves the release of one or more retrograde messengers that act on the presynaptic terminal to enhance transmitter release. Recently, evidence has been presented that retrograde messengers function to activate presynaptic guanylyl cyclase and that the resulting rise in presynaptic cGMP levels, when accompanied by presynaptic activity, is responsible for generating an early component of LTP. We have tested this hypothesis by examining whether synaptic strength is increased by coupling tetanic stimulation with application of a membrane-permeable analog of cGMP. The experiments were done in the presence of an NMDA receptor antagonist to block postsynaptic induction mechanisms. Under a variety of experimental conditions, this manipulation failed to generate LTP, suggesting that an increase in cGMP levels accompanied by presynaptic activity is not sufficient to generate LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus."

To address this question, we interrogated germline sequence data from 4435 pediatric cancer patients at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and 1127 from the National Cancer Institute Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatment (TARGET) database and identified 24 (0.43%) who harbored loss-of-function (LOF) RECQL4 variants, including five of 249 (2.0%) with osteosarcoma (OS). These RECQL4 variants were significantly overrepresented in children with OS, the cancer most frequently observed in patients with RTS, as compared to 134,187 noncancer controls in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD v2.1; P = 0.00087, odds ratio [OR] = 7.1, 95% CI, 2.9–17). Nine of the 24 (38%) individuals possessed the same c.1573delT (p.Cys525Alafs) variant located in the highly conserved DNA helicase domain, suggesting that disruption of this domain is central to oncogenesis. Altogether these data expand our understanding of the genetic factors predisposing to childhood cancer and reveal a novel association between heterozygous RECQL4 LOF variants and development of pediatric OS."

A cosmid was isolated from a human chromosome 6 cosmid library containing the DDR gene. A complete genomic contig of the DDR gene was constructed from seven subclones of the cosmid. The cosmid fragments were analyzed by PCR, sequencing, and comparison of genomic/cDNA sequence. The DDR gene is composed of 17 exons, ranging in size from 96 to 1014 bp, distributed along approximately 12 kb of genomic DNA. The extracellular domain is encoded by 8 exons of which three code for the discoidin domain. The transmembrane domain is encoded by 1 exon, the juxtamembrane by 3 exons, and the catalytic domain by 5 exons. The generation of the two splice variants of DDR, EDDR1 and EDDR2 are explained by the genomic structure. Exon 11 (111 bp in the juxtamembrane domain) is present in DDR and absent in the splice variant EDDR1. An inverted repeat of 20 bp was identified at the 3' exon-intron junction of exon 11, which results in a lariat loop-like secondary structure. EDDR2 is generated because of a cryptic splice acceptor site that results in an extra 18 bp (6 amino acids) inserted 5' of exon 14 in the catalytic domain. A polymorphic (GT)17 repeat was identified in intron 5 with a heterozygosity of 0.71. The exon-intron structure of the DDR gene will be helpful in further understanding of its function and explains the possible structural basis for the two splice variants."

These release acetylcholine (ACh) to inhibit hair cells through activation of calcium-dependent potassium channels. In the mammalian cochlea, ACh shunts and suppresses outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility, reducing the essential amplification of basilar membrane motion. Consequently, medial olivocochlear neurons that inhibit OHCs reduce the sensitivity and frequency selectivity of afferent neurons driven by cochlear vibration of inner hair cells (IHCs). The cholinergic synapse on hair cells involves an unusual ionotropic ACh receptor, and a near-membrane postsynaptic cistern. Lateral olivocochlear (LOC) neurons modulate type I afferents by still-to-be-defined synaptic mechanisms. Olivocochlear neurons can be activated by a reflex arc that includes the auditory nerve and projections from the cochlear nucleus. They are also subject to modulation by higher-order central auditory interneurons. Through its actions on cochlear hair cells, afferent neurons, and higher centers, the olivocochlear system protects against age-related and noise-induced hearing loss, improves signal coding in noise under certain conditions, modulates selective attention to sensory stimuli, and influences sound localization."

Memory decays quickly during the first 3 hr after training and still is measurable 48 hr later. Disruption experiments demonstrate that memory can be disrupted by cold anesthesia within the first approximately 20 min after training, whereas KCl- and CXM-feeding regimens abolish memory soon after training and 3 hr later, respectively.

The sensing of light, its quality, quantity, and duration, is central to plant survival and, as such, serves as a central network hub. Similarly, plants as sessile organisms that can encounter isolation must continually assess their reproductive options, requiring plasticity in propagation by self- and cross-pollination or asexual strategies. Irregular fluctuations and intermittent extremes in temperature, soil fertility, and moisture conditions have given impetus to genetic specializations for network resiliency, protein neofunctionalization, and internal mechanisms to accelerate their evolution. We review some of the current advancements made in understanding plant resiliency and phenotypic plasticity mechanisms. These mechanisms incorporate unusual nuclear–cytoplasmic interactions, various transposable element (TE) activities, and epigenetic plasticity of central gene networks that are broadly pleiotropic to influence resiliency phenotypes."

A paradigm shift is emerging in our understanding of the resolution of inflammation as an active biochemical process with the discovery of novel endogenous specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), including resolvins. Angiogenesis and the resolution of inflammation are critical interdependent processes. Disrupted inflammation resolution can accelerate tumor growth, which is angiogenesis-dependent. SPMs, including resolvins and lipoxins, inhibit physiologic and pathological angiogenesis at nanogram concentrations. The failure of resolution of inflammation is an emerging hallmark of angiogenesis-dependent diseases including arthritis, psoriasis, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, inflammatory bowel disease, atherosclerosis, endometriosis, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. Whereas therapeutic angiogenesis repairs tissue damage (e.g., limb ischemia), inhibition of pathological angiogenesis suppresses tumor growth and other non-neoplastic diseases such as retinopathies. Stimulation of resolution of inflammation via pro-resolving lipid mediators promotes the repair of tissue damage and wound healing, accelerates tissue regeneration, and inhibits cancer. Here we provide an overview of the mechanisms of cross talk between angiogenesis and inflammation resolution in chronic inflammation-driven diseases. Stimulating the resolution of inflammation via pro-resolving lipid mediators has emerged as a promising new field to treat angiogenic diseases."

TCFL5 regulates the expression of genes required for piRNA maturation and promotes transcription of evolutionarily young pachytene piRNA genes, whereas A-MYB activates the transcription of older pachytene piRNA genes. Intriguingly, pachytene piRNAs from TCFL5-dependent young loci initiate the production of piRNAs from A-MYB-dependent older loci, ensuring the self-propagation of pachytene piRNAs. A-MYB and TCFL5 act via a set of incoherent feedforward loops that drive regulation of gene expression by pachytene piRNAs during spermatogenesis.

Instead, an RNA stem-loop structure located downstream of the U2 snRNA coding sequence and transcribed as part of a 3' extended precursor serves as a signal for 3'-end formation. We have identified three mutants that have temperature-sensitive defects in U2 snRNA 3'-end formation. In these mutants, the synthesis of the major snRNAs is also affected and unprocessed rRNA precursors accumulate at the restrictive temperature. Two of these mutants contain the same G-to-A transition within the pac1 gene, whereas the third contains a lesion outside the pac1 locus, indicating that at least two genes are involved. The pac1+ gene is codominant with the mutant allele and can rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype and the defects in snRNA and rRNA synthesis, if overexpressed. In vitro, Pac1p, an RNase III homolog, can cleave a synthetic U2 precursor within the signal for 3'-end formation, generating a product that is a few nucleotides longer than mature U2 snRNA. In addition, U2 precursors are cleaved and trimmed to the mature size in extracts made from wild-type S. pombe cells. However, extracts made from pac1 mutant cells are unable to do so unless they are supplemented with purified recombinant Pac1p. Thus, the 3' end of S. pombe U2 snRNA is generated by a processing reaction that requires Pac1p and an additional component, and can be dissociated from transcription in vitro."

All these genes have been registered in the Genexpress Index, such that sequence, map, and expression data can be used to decipher their role in the physiology and pathology of human muscles."

Reward was manipulated both within and across lists. Bayesian statistics found moderate evidence for the null hypothesis that reward does not modulate forgetting in human free recall."

Although several ICF1 phenotypes have been linked to abnormally hypomethylated repetitive regions, the unique genomic regions responsible for the remaining disease phenotypes remain largely uncharacterized. Here we explored two ICF1 patient–derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their CRISPR-Cas9-corrected clones to determine whether DNMT3B correction can globally overcome DNA methylation defects and related changes in the epigenome. Hypomethylated regions throughout the genome are highly comparable between ICF1 iPSCs carrying different DNMT3B variants, and significantly overlap with those in ICF1 patient peripheral blood and lymphoblastoid cell lines. These regions include large CpG island domains, as well as promoters and enhancers of several lineage-specific genes, in particular immune-related, suggesting that they are premarked during early development. CRISPR-corrected ICF1 iPSCs reveal that the majority of phenotype-related hypomethylated regions reacquire normal DNA methylation levels following editing. However, at the most severely hypomethylated regions in ICF1 iPSCs, which also display the highest increases in H3K4me3 levels and/or abnormal CTCF binding, the epigenetic memory persists, and hypomethylation remains uncorrected. Overall, we demonstrate that restoring the catalytic activity of DNMT3B can reverse the majority of the aberrant ICF1 epigenome. However, a small fraction of the genome is resilient to this rescue, highlighting the challenge of reverting disease states that are due to genome-wide epigenetic perturbations. Uncovering the basis for the persistent epigenetic memory will promote the development of strategies to overcome this obstacle."

Because mosquitoes are a non-model species, however, functional studies of mosquito nervous systems have long been restricted to electrophysiological recording from peripheral sensory organs such as the antenna. This is now changing with the advent of CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing and the development of other powerful new genetic tools. Transgenic mosquitoes that carry genetically encoded calcium sensors, for example, open the door to optical recording of neural activity with two-photon calcium imaging. Compared with electrophysiology, calcium imaging permits continuous monitoring of neural activity from large populations of neurons, even deep in the brain. When combined with selective neural drivers, it also allows targeted recording from specific neuronal types. Here, we describe a calcium imaging protocol we use in our laboratory to study neural activity in the brain of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes."

We report on a patient with EA2 with interictal focal dystonia and also interictal myokymia, which is hitherto not reported as an interictal feature associated to EA2.

There are numerous generic methods and commercial kits for the preparation of genomic DNA based on proteolytic digestion of chromatin components, followed by selective binding of nucleic acids to ion-exchange affinity media, but many of these do not yield DNA that can be readily restricted. Also, molluscan tissues contain mucopolysaccharides, which tend to copurify with DNA under certain conditions. Although nucleic acids prepared this way can serve as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR), other enzymatic modifications of nucleic acids are inhibited by these contaminants. The method described here yields high-molecular-weight DNA that can be readily restricted for Southern hybridization. The procedure uses brain tissue under the assumption that its genome is unlikely to be rearranged in any way, has a high nucleic acid:protein ratio, and avoids potential sources of enzymatic contaminants and parasites from the intestinal sac. However, the method can be applied to other tissue sources and works well with other species. The purification of DNA by gradient centrifugation is an established method based on the specific buoyant density of double-stranded nucleic acids and the ability of CsCl solutions to form a salt gradient in a centrifugal field. It can also be adapted to the purification of RNA, which has a higher buoyant density than DNA. Unfortunately, this method is somewhat involved and expensive and produces large amounts of ethidium bromide waste."

Several ESTs have been positioned and ordered on this contig, one of which is novel to the region, identified by sequence data-base match to a physically mapped YAC insert terminal STS. Integration of the genetic and physical data has placed four retinally expressed genes proximal to DXS6616, and thereby excluded them from a causitive role in RP2.

Past research has uncovered several of its—sometimes stunningly unconventional—principles, but many mysteries remain. Their solution necessitates a concerted transdisciplinary effort to successfully link the neuroanatomical and biophysical properties of mosquito flagellar ears to the behavioral ecology of entire mosquito populations. Neuroanatomically, mosquito ears can rival those of humans in both complexity and sheer size. The approximately 16,000 auditory hair cells within the human organ of Corti, for example, are matched by the approximately 16,000 auditory neurons in the Johnston's organ of a male Anopheles mosquito. Both human and mosquito ears receive very extensive efferent innervation, which modulates their function in ways that are as yet poorly understood. Different populations of neuronal and nonneuronal cell types divide the labor of the mosquito ear amongst themselves. Yet, what exactly this labor is, and how it is achieved, is at best vaguely known. For the majority of mosquitoes, biologically relevant sounds are inextricably linked to their flight tones. Either these flight tones are (directly) the sounds of interest or they contribute (indirectly) to the production of audible sound through a process called nonlinear distortion. Finally, male ears can generate tones themselves: The generation of an internal “phantom copy” of a female flight tone (or self-sustained oscillation ) is believed to aid the male hearing process. Here, we introduce protocols that target the mosquitoes’ auditory neuroanatomy, electrophysiology, and behavior to help shed light on some of these issues."

In addition, 3′ UTRs can establish 3′ UTR-mediated protein–protein interactions (PPIs), and thus can transmit genetic information encoded in 3′ UTRs to proteins. This function has been shown to regulate diverse protein features, including protein complex formation or posttranslational modifications, but is also expected to alter protein conformations. Therefore, 3′ UTR-mediated information transfer can regulate protein features that are not encoded in the amino acid sequence. This review summarizes both 3′ UTR functions—the regulation of mRNA and protein-based processes—and highlights how each 3′ UTR function was discovered with a focus on experimental approaches used and the concepts that were learned. This review also discusses novel approaches to study 3′ UTR functions in the future by taking advantage of recent advances in technology."

Expressed sequence tagged markers corresponding to cathepsin K, a cysteine protease highly expressed in osteoclasts and thought to be important in bone resorption, were mapped previously in the candidate region. We have identified a cytosine to thymidine transition at nucleotide 862 (GenBank accession no. S79895) of the cathepsin K coding sequence in the DNA of an affected individual from a large, consanguinous Mexican family. This mutation results in an arginine to STOP alteration at amino acid 241, predicting premature termination of cathepsin K mRNA translation. All affected individuals in this family were homozygous for the mutation, suggesting that this alteration may lead to pycnodysostosis.

One, a 301-bp region located between the genes, influences both genes and is an enhancer determining the stage and cell type specificity of ovarian transcription. The other, a 105-bp region located in the first exon of yp2, acts across the yp2 promoter region to stimulate yp1 transcription in ovaries. Additional observations suggest how a single enhancer influences both promoters."

GNA nucleotides adopt a rotated nucleobase orientation within all duplex contexts, pairing with complementary RNA in a reverse Watson–Crick mode, which explains the inabilities of GNA C and G to form strong base pairs with complementary nucleotides. Transposition of the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor pairs using novel ( S )-GNA isocytidine and isoguanosine nucleotides resulted in stable base-pairing with the complementary G and C ribonucleotides, respectively. GNA nucleotide or dinucleotide incorporation into an oligonucleotide increased resistance against 3′-exonuclease-mediated degradation. Consistent with the structural observations, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) modified with ( S )-GNA had greater in vitro potencies than identical sequences containing ( R )-GNA. ( S )-GNA is well tolerated in the seed regions of antisense and sense strands of a GalNAc-conjugated siRNA in vitro. The siRNAs containing a GNA base pair in the seed region had in vivo potency when subcutaneously injected into mice. Importantly, seed pairing destabilization resulting from a single GNA nucleotide at position 7 of the antisense strand mitigated RNAi-mediated off-target effects in a rodent model. Two GNA-modified siRNAs have shown an improved safety profile in humans compared with their non-GNA-modified counterparts, and several additional siRNAs containing the GNA modification are currently in clinical development."

The predicted protein shows 42% identity and 57% similarity at the amino acid level to the yeast PWP2 protein, which is a member of the WD-repeat containing superfamily, and potentially encodes a G-protein beta subunit. The PWP2 gene is split into 21 exons, ranging in size from 53 to 516 bp, and spans an estimated 25 kb. The gene is transcribed in a 21cen-->21qter direction, with its 5' end mapping approximately 195 kb proximal to the 5' end of the phosphofructokinase-liver isoform gene. Four single base-pair polymorphisms were identified using single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis.

Unlike mammalian cochlear supporting cells, which have clearly defined subtypes, avian BP supporting cells are deceptively indistinguishable and molecular markers have yet to be identified. Despite the importance of supporting cells as the putative stem cells in avian regeneration, it is unknown whether all supporting cells possess equal capability to give rise to a hair cell or if a specialized subpopulation exists. In this perspective, we reinvigorate the concept of a stem cell in the BP, and form comparisons to other regenerating tissues that show cell-cycle reentry after damage. Special emphasis is given to the structure of the BP and how anatomy informs both the potential, intrinsic heterogeneity of the supporting cell layer as well as the choice between mitotic and nonmitotic regenerative strategies."

These medications are effective in general, although significant variability in drug activity exists between patients. Although this variation may be related in part to a multitude of factors, a growing body of evidence suggests that individual genotypes are a main contributor. The PharmGKB database was mined to prioritize genetic variants with potential clinical relevance for response to aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. Although variants were reported for all drugs, the highest level of evidence was found in cytochrome P450 (CYP450) genotype variation related to clopidogrel response. Individual genetic influences have an impact on the pharmacodynamics of antiplatelet agents. Current clinical practice for stroke prevention is primarily empiric or guided by functional assays; however, there now exists a third potential pathway to base treatment decisions: genotype-guided treatment."

Although the effect of STR variation on gene expression has been extensively assessed, their impact on epigenetics has been poorly studied and limited to specific genomic regions. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that some STRs act as independent regulators of local DNA methylation in the human genome and modify risk of common human traits. To address these questions, we first analyzed two independent data sets comprising PCR-free whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and genome-wide DNA methylation levels derived from whole-blood samples in 245 (discovery cohort) and 484 individuals (replication cohort). Using genotypes for 131,635 polymorphic STRs derived from WGS using HipSTR, we identified 11,870 STRs that associated with DNA methylation levels (mSTRs) of 11,774 CpGs (Bonferroni P < 0.001) in our discovery cohort, with 90% successfully replicating in our second cohort. Subsequently, through fine-mapping using CAVIAR we defined 585 of these mSTRs as the likely causal variants underlying the observed associations (fm-mSTRs) and linked a fraction of these to previously reported genome-wide association study signals, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying complex human traits. Furthermore, by integrating gene expression data, we observed that 12.5% of the tested fm-mSTRs also modulate expression levels of nearby genes, reinforcing their regulatory potential. Overall, our findings expand the catalog of functional sequence variants that affect genome regulation, highlighting the importance of incorporating STRs in future genetic association analysis and epigenetics data for the interpretation of trait-associated variants."

Unexpected was the age of disease expression, normally around the pediatric age, with a predominantly median survival age of 36 yr. To our knowledge, she was the first adult patient with a molecular diagnosis of Shwachman–Diamond in Uruguay. The patient was referred to our service when she was 43-yr-old with a history of bone marrow failure with anemia and thrombocytopenia. All secondary causes of pancytopenia were excluded. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy specimens were hypocellular for the patient's age. Numerous dysplastic features were observed in the three lineages. She had a normal karyotype and normal chromosomal fragility. A diagnosis of low-risk hypoplastic MDS was made. Dermatological examination revealed reticulate skin pigmentation with hypopigmented macules involving the face, neck, and extremities; nail dystrophy; premature graying; and thin hair. Extrahematological manifestations were present (e.g., learning difficulties, short stature). Last, she was diagnosed with cryptogenic liver cirrhosis CHILD C. This rules out all other possible causes of chronic liver disease. This clinical presentation initially oriented the diagnosis toward telomeropathy, so we did a telomeropathy NGS panel that came up negative. Finally, we did an exome sequencing that confirmed the diagnosis of SDS. Using whole-exome sequencing, we were able to find two compound heterozygous mutations in the SBDS gene that were responsible for the phenotype of a patient that was undiagnosed for 10 years. An earlier genetic diagnosis could have influenced our patient's outcome."

Alterations in the epigenetic cityscape of prostate cancer cells compared with normal prostate tissues have a complex interplay with genetic alterations to drive prostate cancer initiation and progression. Indeed, mutations in genes encoding epigenetic enzymes are often observed in human cancers including prostate cancer. Interestingly, alterations in the prostate cancer epigenetic cityscape can be highly recurrent, a facet that can be exploited for development of biomarkers and potentially as therapeutic targets."

Each subclass of Purkinje cells carried essentially the same information about required changes in the gain of the VOR. The correlation of simple-spike activity in Purkinje cells with activity in vestibular pathways could guide learning during low-frequency but not high-frequency stimuli. Climbing fiber activity could guide learning during all stimuli tested but only if compared with the activity present approximately 100 msec earlier in either vestibular pathways or Purkinje cells."

We used intracellular recording to examine plasticity in these neurons, particularly side-specific or site-specific alterations, which may be involved in mediating aspects of the learning induced by tentacle shock. The results of these experiments indicate that the J/K SNs exhibit several forms of plasticity: (1) Post-tetanic potentiation (PTP); (2) heterosynaptic facilitation; (3) activity-dependent synaptic facilitation; and (4) side-specific spike broadening. Furthermore, by activating SNs directly to produce PTP and producing heterosynaptic facilitation with tentacular stimuli that were either inside or outside the receptive field of individual SNs, it was possible to dissect and analyze the differential contribution of intrinsic SN activity and heterosynaptic modulation to activity-dependent facilitation induced by behaviorally relevant stimuli. Collectively, these data raise the possibility that plasticity in primary afferent SNs may be involved in US processing during learning induced by tentacle stimulation."

These analyses identify four kinds of tyrosine tRNA genes, two oocyte-type and two somatic-type, whose unspliced transcripts are distinguishable from one another by their different 5' leader and intervening sequences. The oocyte-type tyrosine tRNA precursors are present in oocytes, very abundant in gastrula embryos, but absent from postembryonic somatic cells. The somatic-type precursors are undetectable in oocytes but are found in gastrula and later stage embryos and in somatic cells. The major switch from oocyte-type to somatic-type transcripts occurs early during embryogenesis, between the midblastula transition and the onset of neurulation, but some oocyte-type precursors are also detectable in tadpoles."

They are maintained in neurons, including long axonal stretches, through dynamic processes such as fission, fusion, biogenesis, and mitophagy. Here, we describe a protocol for the in-depth morphological analysis of individual mitochondria in axons in vivo. Most mitochondrial analysis of axons is currently performed in vitro with neurons in a developmental state. Therefore, an understanding of the axonal mitochondrial network during aging in fully differentiated neurons and the long-term consequence of gene knockout is often not developed. By using a clonal system paired with fluorescent genetically encoded markers in the Drosophila wing, we can visualize individual neurons (out of the whole bundle), including their long axons and the mitochondria that they contain, using confocal imaging. The clonal system also allows visualization of neurons with genetic perturbations that would otherwise be lethal if present in the whole organism, allowing investigators to bypass lethality. This protocol can further be adapted to measure the physiological and biochemical state of the mitochondria. Mitochondrial morphology and health in axons are tightly linked to aging, axon injury, and neurodegeneration; therefore, this method can be used to investigate mitochondrial dysfunction associated with novel genes or those linked to neurodegenerative disease and axonopathy."

Recently, these results have been challenged by the suggestion that learning was not completely blocked in these studies. Instead, it has been suggested that low levels of responses on test sessions might represent a retarded form of learning caused by drug effects on cerebellar cortex. The present study was designed to address this issue directly. Very low doses of muscimol were used to selectively inactivate the interpositus nucleus of rabbits during five conditioning sessions. Animals performed no significant levels of CRs during those sessions. Training was continued four more sessions without any inactivations to test whether any learning had occurred during the previous five sessions. Detailed analysis of responses during session six revealed that learning was completely blocked by the low doses of muscimol infused into the interpositus during the first five sessions. Animals subsequently acquired the CR normally. These results confirm and extend the original findings that appropriate lesions (either temporary or permanent) of the interpositus nucleus completely prevent acquisition of the conditioned eye-blink response. Other issues regarding reversible inactivation studies are also discussed."

Exome sequencing (ES) was pursued in all cases, and chromosomal microarray (CMA) was performed for six cases.

Four definitive diagnosis cases had known pathogenic variants in KCNJ2 , TGFBR1 , SCN1A , and FBN1 , whereas another two cases revealed novel likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants in GNB1 and DNAH9. Our study demonstrates the success in genetic diagnosis in adult patients: four cases with definitive, two cases with possible, and one case with partial diagnosis. The advantage of diagnosis is beyond obtaining the diagnosis itself, but also relieving any doubt for the patient regarding any previous questionable diagnosis, guide for management, and recurrence risk in their children or family members.

Here, we expand this tool kit by developing SEC-seq, a method based on a similar concept as the established Grad-seq approach. In Grad-seq, cellular RNA and protein complexes of a bacterium of interest are separated in a glycerol gradient, followed by high-throughput RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses of individual gradient fractions. New RNA–protein complexes are predicted based on the similarity of their elution profiles. In SEC-seq, we have replaced the glycerol gradient with separation by size exclusion chromatography, which shortens operation times and offers greater potential for automation. Applying SEC-seq to Escherichia coli , we find that the method provides a higher resolution than Grad-seq in the lower molecular weight range up to ∼500 kDa. This is illustrated by the ability of SEC-seq to resolve two distinct, but similarly sized complexes of the global translational repressor CsrA with either of its antagonistic small RNAs, CsrB and CsrC. We also characterized changes in the SEC-seq profiles of the small RNA MicA upon deletion of its RNA chaperones Hfq and ProQ and investigated the redistribution of these two proteins upon RNase treatment. Overall, we demonstrate that SEC-seq is a tractable and reproducible method for the global profiling of bacterial RNA–protein complexes that offers the potential to discover yet-unrecognized associations between bacterial RNAs and proteins."

Within this collection there clearly must be many insertions corresponding to Drosophila genes that have been cloned and characterized, e.g., via homology with cloned mammalian genes, but for which mutant phenotypes have yet to be identified. We have made use of the fact that P[lacW] contains a plasmid replicon to establish a collection of rescued plasmids containing genomic DNA flanking the sites of transposon insertion. Plasmids representing a total of 1836 lines were independently rescued and pooled in batches of 10 and 100. Pools of 100 plasmids were screened by hybridization with cDNAs corresponding to cloned second chromosome loci. Hybridizing pools were then narrowed down to single plasmids by a process of subdivision and rehybridization, and corresponding mutant lines were obtained. The success rate was better than one in four. This rate would undoubtedly be improved by the use of genomic DNA probes."

Hybrid selection as a method of increasing mapping power for radiation hybrids.,Genome Research,Genome Res.,1088-9051,1549-5469,10.1101/gr.6.8.761,https://genome.cshlp.org/content/6/8/761,6,8,08/01/1996,761,769,['H B Jones'],"['Department of Genetics, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EH, United Kingdom. hbj@mole.bio.cam.uc.uk']","Radiation hybrids have become a widely used tool for physical mapping. A drawback of the technique is that large numbers of hybrids are required to construct robust, high-resolution maps. The information contained within a panel of radiation hybrids is limited by the frequency of retention of chromosomal fragments from the donor cell line. In almost all experiments to date, the retention frequency has been below the optimal level; therefore, many hybrids are needed to produce high-quality maps. Because of the labor-intensive nature of large-scale mapping projects, it is important to make panels as small as possible. One method that has been adopted is to produce initially a large number of hybrids that are all typed with a few loci. Those hybrids showing satisfactorily high retention are admitted to the final panel and the rest are discarded. In this way, a panel of radiation hybrids with higher than expected retention can be created. Methods for conducting such a selection regime are discussed. To investigate the potential advantages of selecting hybrids based on their retention frequency, simulations were run under a variety of conditions. As expected panels with high retention (40%) provided better mapping resources than panels with lower (20%) retention. Beginning with an initial panel of 200 hybrids, comparisons of a random sample of 100 hybrids and the set of those 100 hybrids showing the highest marker retention demonstrated that selection may not be always the best strategy despite the increase in mean retention it yields. The selection of hybrids containing large numbers of fragments leads to an overestimation of the frequency of radiation-induced breaks. When breaks occur with high frequency (for example, when high radiation doses are used), the selection of hybrids leads to a loss of linkage and hence an inability to order the markers. As such, the merits of screening hybrids depends on both the radiation dose and the desired map resolution."
Probabilistic classification learning in amnesia.,Learning & Memory,Learn.

In each of three tasks, four different cues were each probabilistically associated with one of two outcomes. On each trial, the cues could appear alone or in combination with other cues and subjects selected the outcome they thought was correct. Feedback was provided after each trial. In each task, the amnesic patients learned gradually to associate the cues with the appropriate outcome at the same rate as control subjects, improving from 50% correct to approximately 65% correct. Presumably because the cue-outcome associations were probabilistic, declarative memory for the outcomes of specific trials was not as useful for performance as the information gradually accrued across trials. Nevertheless, declarative memory does appear to make a contribution to performance when training is extended beyond approximately 50 trials, because with further training control subjects eventually outperformed the amnesic patients. It was also demonstrated that performance on the probabilistic classification task was not the result of holding knowledge of cue-outcome associations in short-term memory, because both control subjects and amnesic patients demonstrated significant savings when testing was interrupted by a 5-min delay (experiment 2). Probabilistic classification learning appears to provide an analog in human subjects for the habit learning tasks that can be acquired normally by animals with hippocampal lesions."
Structure of the human alpha 2 subunit gene of the glycine receptor--use of vectorette and Alu-exon PCR.,Genome Research,Genome Res.,1088-9051,1549-5469,10.1101/gr.6.12.1200,https://genome.cshlp.org/content/6/12/1200,6,12,12/01/1996,1200,1206,"['U Monani', 'A H Burghes']",,"The alpha subunit of the glycine receptor is encoded by multiple genes that display developmental and tissue-specific expression. The alpha 1 subunit gene is expressed predominantly in the adult brain stem and spinal cord, whereas the alpha 2 subunit gene is expressed in fetal brain and spinal cord. We wished to determine the genomic organization of the human alpha 2 subunit gene as well as to define the 5' ends of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunit genes. Gene structure can be defined rapidly from yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) DNA sources by the use of vectorette-exon polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, YACs frequently contain small deletions that complicate the determination of the complete exon-intron structure of a gene, and this often necessitates the isolation of additional clones. In this study we have used vectorette-exon PCR from YAC DNA to define exons of the glycine receptor alpha 2 subunit gene. To define those exons that were absent in the isolated YACs, we used Alu-exon PCR on genomic DNA, using nested primers to obtain specificity in the PCR reactions. The alpha 2 subunit gene was found to contain nine exons varying in size from 68 bp (exons 3A and 3B) to 581 bp (exon l). All of the intron-exon boundary sequences conform to consensus splice donor and acceptor sites. In addition, we have defined the 5' end of this gene as well as that of the alpha 1 subunit gene by RACE-PCR. The structures of the alpha subunit glycine receptor genes in humans are very similar to each other and to the alpha subunit genes in mice."

However, little is known about the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that determine how these stem cells are maintained and how they give rise to their diverse differentiated progeny. To address such questions, a thorough understanding of transcriptional regulation in Hydra is needed. To this end, we generated extensive new resources for characterizing transcriptional regulation in Hydra , including new genome assemblies for Hydra oligactis and the AEP strain of Hydra vulgaris , an updated whole-animal single-cell RNA-seq atlas, and genome-wide maps of chromatin interactions, chromatin accessibility, sequence conservation, and histone modifications. These data revealed the existence of large kilobase-scale chromatin interaction domains in the Hydra genome that contain transcriptionally coregulated genes. We also uncovered the transcriptomic profiles of two previously molecularly uncharacterized cell types: isorhiza-type nematocytes and somatic gonad ectoderm. Finally, we identified novel candidate regulators of cell type–specific transcription, several of which have likely been conserved at least since the divergence of Hydra and the jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica more than 400 million years ago."

Important stimulus-coding events occur in peripheral sensory neurons, which express specific combinations of chemosensory receptors with defined ligand-response profiles. These receptors convert ligand recognition into spatial and temporal patterns of neural activity that are transmitted to, and interpreted in, central brain regions. Drosophila melanogaster provides an attractive model to study chemosensory coding because it possesses relatively simple peripheral olfactory and gustatory systems that display many organizational parallels to those of vertebrates. Moreover, nearly all peripheral chemosensory neurons have been molecularly characterized and are accessible for physiological analysis, as they are exposed on the surface of sensory organs housed in specialized hairs called sensilla. Here, we briefly review anatomical, molecular, and physiological properties of adult Drosophila olfactory and gustatory systems and provide background to methods for electrophysiological recordings of ligand-evoked activity from different types of chemosensory sensilla."

This proposal derives from neurobiological studies of these regions of the rat cerebellum. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lateral cerebellar output nucleus (dentate) of humans during passive and active sensory tasks confirmed four a priori implications of this hypothesis. Dentate nuclei responded to cutaneous stimuli, even when there were no accompanying overt finger movements. Finger movements not associated with tactile sensory discrimination produced no dentate activation. Sensory discrimination with the fingers induced an increase in dentate activation, with or without finger movements. Finally, dentate activity was greatest when there was the most opportunity to modulate the acquisition of the sensory tactile data: when the discrimination involved the active repositioning of tactile sensory surface of the fingers. Furthermore, activity in cerebellar cortex was strongly correlated with observed dentate activity. This distinct four-way pattern of effects strongly challenges other cerebellar theories. However, contrary to appearances, neither our hypothesis nor findings conflict with behavioral effects of cerebellar damage, neurophysiological data on animals performing motor tasks, or cerebellar contribution to nonmotor, perceptual, and cognitive tasks."

Some of its functions are achieved by a cross talk with other intracellular membranous organelles and with the plasma membrane at membrane contacts sites (MCSs). As the ER synthesizes most membrane lipids, lipid exchanges mediated by lipid transfer proteins at MCSs are a particularly important aspect of this cross talk, which synergizes with the cross talk mediated by vesicular transport. Several mutations of genes that encode proteins localized at ER MCSs result in familial neurodegenerative diseases, emphasizing the importance of the normal lipid traffic within cells for a healthy brain. Here, we provide an overview of such diseases, with a specific focus on proteins that directly or indirectly impact lipid transport."

The DNA binding activity of E2F, detected in vitro using nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells, is increased by adenovirus infection (termed E2F induction). We demonstrate here that a 19.5-kD protein, encoded by adenovirus early region 4 (E4) open reading frame (ORF) 6/7, is primarily responsible for the induction of E2F DNA binding activity to the E2 promoter region. Viral mutants that contain frame-shift mutations in E4 ORF 6/7 failed to induce E2F binding activity; a virus that carries an E4 ORF 6/7 cDNA in place of the E4-coding sequences induced E2F efficiently. Using gel mobility shift assays, we demonstrate that the E4 ORF 6/7 product induces the binding of E2F to the E2 promoter via a direct complex. The addition of a peptide-specific antiserum, directed against the E4 ORF 6/7 protein, to an in vitro E2F-binding reaction resulted in the formation of a DNA-protein complex with reduced gel mobility compared to the normal, adenovirus-induced E2F-E2 promoter complex. The formation of the E2F-E2 promoter-antibody complex was blocked by the addition of the cognate peptide used to generate the antiserum but not by a nonspecific peptide. Nuclear extracts prepared from adenovirus-infected HeLa cells were cleared of E2F binding activity using the ORF 6/7 peptide-specific serum, but not the preimmune serum, suggesting that E2F and the E4 ORF 6/7 product form a protein-protein complex in solution. The adenovirus E1A proteins are not absolutely required for the induction of E2F binding activity because the infection of HeLa cells with an E1A mutant, dl312, at high multiplicity resulted in E2F induction. Under these conditions of infection, the E4 ORF 6/7 product was synthesized. E2F binding activity was induced, but inefficiently, in cells infected with E4 ORF 6/7 mutants, indicating that an additional pathway may lead to E2F induction."

There is evidence that combinations of silent genes are involved in the generation of this repertoire, but the combination rules are not known. To gain insight into these rules, we determined the fine structure of a composite gene. The gene coding for the variant surface glycoprotein 20 of T. equiperdum is a late gene generated by the partial duplication of three silent pseudogenes. Two closely related but not identical '5' donors' form a mosaic coding for the antigenic portion of the protein. A telomeric '3' donor' provides the last 200 nucleotides of the expressed gene. The sequences of the 5' and 3' donors are not related except for a short segment in which the hybrid junction is formed. These results demonstrate that recombinational processes generate diversity by reassorting sequences and also allow the expression of pseudogenes. Furthermore, the use of a short sequence similarity for the formation of the 5'-3' donor hybrid suggests a mechanism that may act in ordering the expression of the variant surface glycoproteins."

Here we show that despite the variability of mammalian branch sites, U2 snRNP has a sequence-specific RNA-binding activity. Thus, RNA branch formation is regulated by two sequence-specific interactions: U2AF with the 3' splice site/polypyrimidine tract, and U2 snRNP with the branch site. The affinity of the branch site for U2 snRNP affects the efficiency of spliceosome assembly and splicing."
Characterization of a novel deep-intronic variant in DYNC2H1 identified by whole-exome sequencing in a patient with a lethal form of a short-rib thoracic dysplasia type III,Molecular Case Studies,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud,,2373-2873,10.1101/mcs.a006254,http://molecularcasestudies.cshlp.org/content/8/7/a006254,8,7,12/01/2022,a006254,,"['Muqsit Buchh', 'Patrick J.

In this report, we review the case of a patient who was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of Indiana University Health (IUH) for respiratory support after experiencing respiratory distress secondary to a small, narrow chest causing restrictive lung disease. Additional phenotypic features include postaxial polydactyly, short proximal long bones, and ambiguous genitalia were noted. Exome sequencing (ES) revealed a maternally inherited likely pathogenic variant c.10322C > T p.(Leu3448Pro) in the DYNC2H1 gene. However, there was no variant found on the paternal allele. Microarray analysis to detect deletion or duplication in DYNC2H1 was normal. Therefore, there was insufficient evidence to establish a molecular diagnosis. To further explore the data and perform additional investigations, the patient was subsequently enrolled in the Undiagnosed Rare Disease Clinic (URDC) at Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM). The investigators at the URDC performed a reanalysis of the ES raw data, which revealed a paternally inherited DYNC2H1 deep-intronic variant c.10606-14A > G predicted to create a strong cryptic acceptor splice site. Additionally, the RNA sequencing of fibroblasts demonstrated partial intron retention predicted to cause a premature stop codon and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Droplet digital RT-PCR (RT-ddPCR) showed a drastic reduction by 74% of DYNCH2H1 mRNA levels. As a result, the intronic variant was subsequently reclassified as likely pathogenic resulting in a definitive clinical and genetic diagnosis for this patient. Reanalysis of ES and fibroblast mRNA experiments confirmed the pathogenicity of the splicing variants to supplement critical information not revealed in original ES or CMA reports. The NICU and URDC collaboration ended the diagnostic odyssey for this family; furthermore, its importance is emphasized by the possibility of prenatally diagnosing the mother's current pregnancy."

Edenberg', 'Yunlong Liu']",,"The genetics of complex diseases has been given a tremendous boost in recent years by the introduction of high-throughput laboratory methods that make it possible to approach larger questions in larger populations and to cover the genome more comprehensively. The ability to determine genotypes of many individuals accurately and efficiently has allowed genetic studies that cover more of the variation within individual genes, instead of focusing only on one or a few coding variants, and to do so in study samples of reasonable power. Chip-based genotyping assays, combined with knowledge of the patterns of coinheritance of markers (linkage disequilibrium [LD]), have stimulated genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex diseases. Recent successes of GWAS in identifying specific genes that affect risk for common diseases are dramatic illustrations of how improved technology can lead to scientific breakthroughs. A key issue in high-throughput genotyping is to choose the appropriate technology for your goals and for the stage of your experiment, being cognizant of your sample numbers and resources. This article introduces some of the commonly used methods of high-throughput single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping for different stages of genetic studies and briefly reviews some of the high-throughput sequencing methods just coming into use. It also mentions some recent developments in “next-generation” sequencing that will enable other kinds of studies. This article is not intended to be comprehensive, and because technology in this area is rapidly changing, our comments should be taken as a starting point for further investigation."

Recently, major advances have been made by passaging primary HEV isolates and selecting variants that replicate efficiently in carcinoma cells. These adaptations, however, can alter HEV biology. We have explored human embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cell (hESC/iPSC)-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) as an alternative to conventional hepatoma and hepatocyte cell culture systems for HEV studies. HLCs are permissive for nonadapted HEV isolate genotypes (gt)1–4 replication and can be readily genetically manipulated. HLCs, therefore, enable studies of pan-genotype HEV biology and will serve as a platform for testing anti-HEV treatments. Finally, we discuss how hepatocyte polarity is likely an important factor in the maturation and spread of infectious HEV particles."

The temporal and spatial characteristics of cytosolic Ca 2+ increases are mainly governed by the fluxes of this ion across the membrane of the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane. However, various Ca 2+ transporters also allow for Ca 2+ exchanges between the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Increases in mitochondrial Ca 2+ stimulate the production of ATP, which allows the cells to cope with the increased energy demand created by the stimulus. Less widely appreciated is the fact that Ca 2+ handling by mitochondria also shapes cytosolic Ca 2+ signals. Indeed, the frequency, amplitude, and duration of cytosolic Ca 2+ increases can be altered by modifying the rates of Ca 2+ transport into, or from, mitochondria. In this review, we focus on the interplay between mitochondria and Ca 2+ signaling, highlighting not only the consequences of cytosolic Ca 2+ changes on mitochondrial Ca 2+ , but also how cytosolic Ca 2+ dynamics is controlled by modifications of the Ca 2+ -handling properties and the metabolism of mitochondria."

Domain IV of SRP RNA consists of a short stem-loop structure with two internal loops that contain the most conserved nucleotides of the molecule. All known essential interactions of SRP occur in that moiety containing domain IV. The solution structure of a 43-nt RNA comprising the complete Escherichia coli domain IV was determined by multidimensional NMR and restrained molecular dynamics refinement. Our data confirm the previously determined rigid structure of a smaller subfragment containing the most conserved, symmetric internal loop A (Schmitz et al., Nat Struct Biol, 1999, 6:634-638), where all conserved nucleotides are involved in nucleotide-specific structural interactions. Asymmetric internal loop B provides a hinge in the RNA molecule; it is partially flexible, yet also uniquely structured. The longer strand of internal loop B extends the major groove by creating a ledge-like arrangement; for loop B however, there is no obvious structural role for the conserved nucleotides. The structure of domain IV suggests that loop A is the initial site for the RNA/protein interaction creating specificity, whereas loop B provides a secondary interaction site."

Additional information was obtained for some markers by following segregation in the AgResearch International Mapping Flock, consisting of nine three-generation full-sib pedigrees. A pseudoautosomal region containing two markers has been identified at one end of the linkage map. Comparisons with mouse and human X chromosomes confirms the observation of Ohno (1973) that the gene content of the mammalian X chromosome is retained. In particular, the conserved grouping of the genes PHKA1, ATP7A, and XIST observed in both the human and the mouse X chromosome appears to be conserved in the sheep X chromosome, and XIST has been mapped to near the center of the chromosome. This study provides the first reported genetic linkage map combining both type I and type II markers for any ruminant X chromosome."

In a reversal conditioning procedure using heat as reinforcement, flies can be trained to successively prefer different flight orientations with respect to the patterns. As in many learning paradigms, conditioned responses are highly variable. Although during training most flies reliably avoid the heat and the corresponding flight orientations, in subsequent learning tests without heat some show no consistent preference for the permissive orientations. We have started to investigate the interindividual differences in learning performance and describe here three significant variables: the age of the animals, their experience in the flight simulator prior to the experiment, and the composition of the fly food. Flies learn more reliably at 3-4 days than at 1-2 days of age but learning indices do not increase further in even older flies. Learning is improved if flies are allowed to become familiar with the flight simulator before the start of the conditioning procedure. Most important, poor nutrition causes complete amnesia within three or four generations. The reverse shift from poor to nutritious food restores learning ability with an even longer delay."
Activity-dependent enhancement of presynaptic facilitation provides a cellular mechanism for the temporal specificity of classical conditioning in Aplysia.,Learning & Memory,Learn.

To further examine the cellular mechanisms contributing to the temporal specificity of classical conditioning of the siphon-withdrawal response in Aplysia, we paired action potential activity in siphon sensory neurons (the neural CS) with tail nerve shock (the US) at three critical time points. We found that CS-US pairings at short (0.5 sec) forward intervals produced greater synaptic facilitation at sensorimotor connections than did either 0.5-sec backward pairings or longer (5 sec) forward pairings, as reflected in a differential increase in both the amplitude and rate of rise of the synaptic potential. In the same preparations, forward pairings also differentially reduced the sensory neuron afterhyperpolarization relative to backward pairings, suggesting that changes in synaptic efficacy were accompanied by temporally specific changes in ionic currents in the sensory neurons. Additional experiments demonstrated that short forward pairings of sensory cell activity and restricted applications of the neuromodulatory transmitter serotonin (normally released by the US) differentially enhanced action potential broadening in siphon sensory neurons, relative to backward pairings. Taken together, these results suggest that temporally specific synaptic enhancement engages both spike-width-dependent and spike-width-independent facilitatory processes and that activity-dependent enhancement of presynaptic facilitation may contribute to both the CS-US sequence and proximity requirements of conditioning."
Peptidyl transferase antibiotics perturb the relative positioning of the 3'-terminal adenosine of P/P'-site-bound tRNA and 23S rRNA in the ribosome.,RNA,RNA,1355-8382,1469-9001,,http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/5/8/1003,5,8,08/01/1999,1003,1013,"['S V Kirillov', 'B T Porse', 'R A Garrett']","['RNA Regulation Centre, Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.']","A range of antibiotic inhibitors that act within the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome were examined for their capacity to perturb the relative positioning of the 3' end of P/P'-site-bound tRNA and the Escherichia coli ribosome. The 3'-terminal adenosines of deacylated tRNA and N-Ac-Phe-tRNA were derivatized at the 2 position with an azido group and the tRNAs were cross-linked to the ribosome on irradiation with ultraviolet light at 365 nm. The cross-links were localized on the rRNA within extended versions of three previously characterized 23S rRNA fragments F1', F2', and F4' at nucleotides C2601/A2602, U2584/U2585 (F1'), U2506 (F2'), and A2062/C2063 (F4'). Each of these nucleotides lies within the peptidyl transferase loop region of the 23S rRNA. Cross-links were also formed with ribosomal proteins L27 (strong) and L33 (weak), as shown earlier. The antibiotics sparsomycin, chloramphenicol, the streptogramins pristinamycin IA and IIA, gougerotin, lincomycin, and spiramycin were tested for their capacity to alter the identities or yields of each of the cross-links. Although no new cross-links were detected, each of the drugs produced major changes in cross-linking yields, mainly decreases, at one or more rRNA sites but, with the exception of chloramphenicol, did not affect cross-linking to the ribosomal proteins. Moreover, the effects were closely similar for both deacylated and N-Ac-Phe-tRNAs, indicating that the drugs selectively perturb the 3' terminus of the tRNA. The strongest decreases in the rRNA cross-links were observed with pristinamycin IIA and chloramphenicol, which correlates with their both producing complex chemical footprints on 23S rRNA within E. coli ribosomes. Furthermore, gougerotin and pristinamycin IA strongly increased the yields of fragments F2' (U2506) and F4' (U2062/C2063), respectively. The results obtained with an RNAse H approach correlate well with primer extension data implying that cross-linking occurs primarily to the bases. Both sets of data are also consistent with the results of earlier rRNA footprinting experiments on antibiotic-ribosome complexes. It is concluded that the antibiotics perturb the relative positioning of the 3' end of the P/P'-site-bound tRNA and the peptidyl transferase loop region of 23S rRNA."

We show that the insertion of an oligonucleotide that contains the CP2 G-box restores regulated expression whereas the insertion of oligonucleotides that contain mutations in some of the G residues does not. Moreover, the mutant oligonucleotides do not compete for binding of the factor to the wild-type sequence. The activity of the G-box binding factor (GBF) is regulated developmentally with induction of activity occurring at the time of induction of pst-cathepsin expression. In a single-cell culture, GBF activity is inducible by cAMP, and its appearance is inhibited by cycloheximide, which suggests that the factor, or a protein component required for binding of the factor, is directly induced by cAMP and may be the rate-limiting factor required for cAMP induction of pst-cathepsin expression. Models for cAMP induction of prestalk genes are described."

They are located at the tips of stereocilia and are required for hair cell mechanotransduction. TMC1 assembles as a dimer and its similarity to the TMEM16s has enabled a predicted tertiary structure with an ion conduction pore in each subunit of the dimer.

It is also successfully used as treatment for disorders in which the nervous system is affected or implicated. Typically, neurostimulation is delivered in open-loop mode (i.e., according to a predetermined schedule and independently of the state of the organ or physiological system whose function is sought to be modulated). However, the physiology of the nervous system or the modulated organ can be dynamic, and the same stimulus may have different effects depending on the underlying state. As a result, open-loop stimulation may fail to restore the desired function or cause side effects. In such cases, a neuromodulation intervention may be preferable to be administered in closed-loop mode. In a closed-loop neuromodulation (CLN) system, stimulation is delivered when certain physiological states or conditions are met (responsive neurostimulation); the stimulation parameters can also be adjusted dynamically to optimize the effect of stimulation in real time (adaptive neurostimulation). In this review, the reasons and the conditions for using CLN are discussed, the basic components of a CLN system are described, and examples of CLN systems used in physiological and translational research are presented."

In hippocampi obtained from animals that were untrained, activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor by the specific agonist trans-1-amino-cyclopentyl-1,3-dicarboxylate (ACPD) increased release of glutamate but only in the presence of a low concentration of arachidonic acid. A similar interaction between arachidonic acid and ACPD was observed on inositol phospholipid turnover and on PKC activity. However, the synergistic effect of arachidonic acid and ACPD on glutamate release was occluded in hippocampal synaptosomes prepared from trained rats. Occlusion of the effect on inositol phospholipid turnover and PKC activation was also observed. These data suggest that the molecular changes that underlie spatial learning may include activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors in the presence of arachidonic acid and that the interaction between arachidonic acid and ACPD triggers the presynaptic changes that accompany learning."

Traditional diagnostics have targeted a single characteristic (e.g., spectral response, surface receptor, mass, intrinsic conductivity, etc.). However, advances in detection technologies have identified emerging approaches in which multiple modes of action are combined to obtain enhanced performance characteristics. Particularly appealing in this regard, electrophotonic devices capable of coupling light to electron translocation have experienced rapid recent growth and offer significant advantages for diagnostics. In this review, we explore three specific promising approaches that combine electronics and photonics: (1) assays based on closed bipolar electrochemistry coupling electron transfer to color or fluorescence, (2) sensors based on localized surface plasmon resonances, and (3) emerging nanophotonics approaches, such as those based on zero-mode waveguides and metamaterials."
Axial Patterning in Hydra,Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol,,1943-0264,10.1101/cshperspect.a000463,http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/1/1/a000463,1,1,07/01/2009,a000463,,['Hans R. Bode'],"['Department of Developmental and Cell Biology, University of California Irvine, California 92697']","Morphogen gradients play an important role in pattern formation during early stages of embryonic development in many bilaterians. In an adult hydra, axial patterning processes are constantly active because of the tissue dynamics in the adult. These processes include an organizer region in the head, which continuously produces and transmits two signals that are distributed in gradients down the body column. One signal sets up and maintains the head activation gradient, which is a morphogenetic gradient. This gradient confers the capacity of head formation on tissue of the body column, which takes place during bud formation, hydra's mode of asexual reproduction, as well as during head regeneration following bisection of the animal anywhere along the body column. The other signal sets up the head inhibition gradient, which prevents head formation, thereby restricting bud formation to the lower part of the body column in an adult hydra. Little is known about the molecular basis of the two gradients. In contrast, the canonical Wnt pathway plays a central role in setting up and maintaining the head organizer."

Macrophages also participate in many nonimmune functions, particularly those related to tissue maintenance and injury response. The sensory organs of the inner ear contain resident populations of macrophages, and additional macrophages enter the ear after acoustic trauma or ototoxicity. As expected, such macrophages participate in the clearance of cellular debris. However, otic macrophages can also influence the long-term survival of both hair cells and afferent neurons after injury. The signals that recruit macrophages into the injured ear, as well as the precise contributions of macrophages to inner ear pathology, remain to be determined."

However, these methods have fundamental limitations and are not optimized for the highly sparse single-cell count data. To address these limitations, we propose scDHMap, a model-based deep learning approach to visualize the complex hierarchical structures of scRNA-seq data in low-dimensional hyperbolic space. The evaluations on extensive simulation and real experiments show that scDHMap outperforms existing dimensionality-reduction methods in various common analytical tasks as needed for scRNA-seq data, including revealing trajectory branches, batch correction, and denoising the count matrix with high dropout rates. In addition, we extend scDHMap to visualize single-cell ATAC-seq data."

The majority of BRCA1 function requires heterodimerization with BARD1. In contrast to BRCA1 , BARD1 is a low-penetrance gene with an unclear clinical relevance, partly because of limited functional evidence. Using patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells, we functionally characterized two pathogenic variants (c.1833dupT, c.2099delG) and three variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) (c.73G>C, c.1217G>A, c.1918C>A). Three of these patients had breast cancers, whereas the remaining had colorectal cancers ( n = 3). Both patients with pathogenic variants (c.1833dupT, c.2099delG) developed breast cancers with aggressive disease phenotypes such as triple-negative breast cancer and high cancer grades. As BARD1 encompasses multiple functional domains, including those of apoptosis and homologous recombination repair, we hypothesized that the function being impaired would correspond with the domain where the variant was located. Variants c.1918C>A, c.1833dupT, c.1217G>A, and c.2099delG, located within and proximal to apoptotic domains of ankyrin and BRCT, were associated with impaired apoptosis. Conversely, apoptosis function was preserved in c.73G>C, which was distant from the ankyrin domain. All variants displayed normal BRCA1 heterodimerization and RAD51 colocalization, consistent with their location being distal to BRCA1—and RAD51-binding domains. In view of deficient apoptosis, VUSs (c.1217G>A and c.1918C>A) may be pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. In summary, functional analysis of BARD1 VUSs requires a combination of assays and, more importantly, the use of appropriate functional assays with consideration to the variant's location."

This unique stepwise process is mediated by the editosome, a multiprotein complex that is a validated drug target of considerable interest in addressing the unmet medical needs for kinetoplastid diseases. With that objective, several in vitro RNA editing assays have been developed, albeit with limited success in discovering potent inhibitors. This manuscript describes the development of three hammerhead ribozyme (HHR) FRET reporter-based RNA editing assays for precleaved deletion, insertion, and ligation assays that bypass the rate-limiting endonucleolytic cleavage step, providing information on U-deletion, U-insertion, and ligation activities. These assays exhibit higher editing efficiencies in shorter incubation times while requiring significantly less purified editosome and 10,000-fold less ATP than the previously published full round of in vitro RNA editing assay. Moreover, modifications in the reporter ribozyme sequence enable the feasibility of multiplexing a ribozyme-based insertion/deletion editing (RIDE) assay that simultaneously surveils U-insertion and deletion editing suitable for HTS. These assays can be used to find novel chemical compounds with chemotherapeutic applications or as probes for studying the editosome machinery."

However, performing either IGH/MYC D-FISH or MYC BAP FISH studies in isolation has been reported to result in false-negative results because of the complex nature of 8q24 rearrangements involving the MYC gene region. We report a 60-yr-old male with newly diagnosed high-grade B-cell lymphoma with a negative MYC BAP study, but with positive BCL2 and BCL6 BAP studies. Per our current laboratory algorithm to concurrently interrogate the MYC gene region with both MYC BAP and IGH / MYC D-FISH probe sets, we performed IGH/MYC D-FISH studies and detected an IGH/MYC fusion. To further characterize the discrepant MYC results obtained by FISH, a next-generation sequencing strategy, mate-pair sequencing (MPseq), was performed and revealed a small insertion (∼200 kb) of the IGH locus downstream from the MYC gene that was undetectable by MYC BAP studies. This case highlights the importance of utilizing both IGH/MYC D-FISH and MYC BAP sets to detect potential cryptic MYC rearrangements and also demonstrates the power of MPseq to characterize complex structural rearrangements and copy-number abnormalities unappreciable by FISH."
Chloroplast C-to-U RNA editing in vascular plants is adaptive due to its restorative effect: testing the restorative hypothesis,RNA,RNA,1355-8382,1469-9001,10.1261/rna.079450.122,http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/29/2/141,29,2,02/01/2023,141,152,"['Yuange Duan', 'Wanzhi Cai', 'Hu Li']","['Key Laboratory of Pest Monitoring and Green Management, Department of Entomology, College of Plant Protection, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China']","The adaptiveness of nonsynonymous RNA editing (recoding) could be conferred by the flexibility of the temporal-spatially controllable proteomic diversity, or by its restorative effect which fixes unfavorable genomic mutations at the RNA level. These two complementary hypotheses, namely, the diversifying hypothesis and the restorative hypothesis, have distinct predictions on the landscape of RNA editing sites. We collected the chloroplast C-to-U RNA editomes of 21 vascular plants (11 angiosperms, four gymnosperms, and six ferns) from a previous study, aiming to testify whether the plant editomes typically conform to the restorative hypothesis. All predictions made by the restorative hypothesis are verified: (i) nonsynonymous editing sites are more frequent and have higher editing levels than synonymous sites; (ii) nonsynonymous editing levels are extremely high and show weak tissue-specificity in plants; (iii) on the inferred genomic sites with recent T-to-C mutations, nonsynonymous sites but not synonymous sites are compensated by C-to-U RNA editing. In conclusion, nonsynonymous C-to-U RNA editing in plants is adaptive due to its restorative effects. The recoding levels are high and are constantly required across the whole plant so that the recoding events could perfectly mimic DNA mutations. The evolutionary significance of plant RNA editing is systematically demonstrated at the genome-wide level."

Werren', 'David W. Loehlin']","['Department of Biology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, USA']","Nasonia is a complex of four closely related species of wasps that is rapidly emerging as a model for evolutionary and developmental genetics. It has several features that make it an excellent genetic system, including a short generation time, ease of rearing, interfertile species, visible and molecular markers, and a sequenced genome. The form of sex determination, called “haplodiploidy,” makes Nasonia particularly suitable as a genetic tool. Females are diploid and develop from fertilized eggs, whereas males are haploid and develop from unfertilized eggs. This allows geneticists to exploit many of the advantages of haploid genetics in an otherwise complex eukaryotic organism. Nasonia readily inbreeds, permitting production of isogenic lines, and the four species in the genus are interfertile (after removal of the endosymbiont Wolbachia ), facilitating movement of genes between the species for efficient positional cloning of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Genome sequencing of the genetic model Nasonia vitripennis and two interfertile species, Nasonia giraulti and Nasonia longicornis , is now completed. This genome project provides a wealth of interspecies polymorphisms (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs], insertion-deletions [indels], microsatellites) to facilitate positional cloning of genes involved in species differences in behavior, morphology, and development. Advances in the genetics of this system also open a path for improvement of parasitoid insects as agents of pest control."

In transgenic mice, a fusion gene consisting of 3 kb of prolactin 5'-flanking region fused to a firefly luciferase or human growth hormone (hGH) reporter gene is expressed at high levels with the strict tissue and cell-type specificity that is characteristic of the endogenous prolactin gene. High levels of expression require two cis-acting regions: a distal enhancer (-1.8 to -1.5 kb) and a proximal region (-422 to +33 bp). Each of these regions alone can direct low levels of fusion gene expression to prolactin-producing cell types in transgenic mice, but a synergistic interaction between these regions is necessary for high levels of expression. The ontogeny of the prolactin transgene expression closely follows the appearance of high levels of a POU homeo-domain transcription factor, Pit-1, that has been shown previously to bind structurally related sequences in both the distal enhancer and proximal regions and to activate the expression of the prolactin gene in vitro. Unexpectedly, transgenes containing the distal enhancer removed from its normal context are expressed in both the prolactin-producing lactotrophs and the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-producing thyrotrophs, thereby suggesting that sequences flanking this enhancer are necessary to restrict expression to the correct cell type within the pituitary. These data indicate that distinct processes of gene activation and restriction are necessary for the fidelity of cell-type-specific expression within an organ."

Full-length, polyadenylated gn1 transcripts primarily accumulated in expressing plants, whereas in silenced T17 plants, mainly 3'-truncated, nonpolyadenylated gn1 RNAs were detected. The relative abundance of these 3'-truncated gn1 RNA species gradually increased during the establishment of silencing in homozygous T17 plants. Similar 3'-truncated, nonpolyadenylated gn1 RNA products were observed in an independent case of beta-1,3-glucanase posttranscriptional gene silencing. This suggests that these 3'-truncated gn1 RNAs are a general feature of tobacco plants showing posttranscriptional silencing of the gn1 transgene."

However, recent publications document that heterozygous variants can lead to a variety of phenotypes, such as Wolfram-like syndrome or isolated features of Wolfram syndrome. In this case report, we present a male patient with a history of congenital cataracts and subjective complaints of muscle weakness. Clinical assessment demonstrated normal muscle strength, and genomic, biochemical, electrophysiologic, and muscle biopsy studies did not identify a potential cause of the proband's perceived muscle weakness. Whole-exome sequencing identified a novel de novo variant in the WFS1 gene (c.1243G > T), representing one of only several patients in the published literature with isolated congenital cataracts and a heterozygous WFS1 variant. The variety of phenotypes associated with heterozygous variants in WFS1 suggests that this gene should be considered as a cause of both dominant and biallelic/recessive forms of disease. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanism(s) of disease and variable expressivity in WFS1 in order to improve our ability to provide patients and families with anticipatory guidance about the disease, including appropriate screening and medical interventions."

To do this, SelB binds simultaneously to selenocysteyl-tRNA(Sec) and to an RNA hairpin structure in the mRNA of formiate dehydrogenases located directly 3' of the selenocysteine opal (UGA) codon. The protein is also thought to contain binding sites allowing its interaction with ribosomal proteins and/or rRNA. SelB thus includes specific binding sites for a variety of different RNA molecules. We used an in vitro selection approach with a pool completely randomized at 40 nt to isolate new high-affinity SelB-binding RNA motifs. Our main objective was to investigate which of the various RNA-binding domains in SelB would turn out to be prime targets for aptamer interaction. The resulting sequences were compared with those from a previous SELEX experiment using a degenerate pool of the wild-type formiate dehydrogenase H (fdhF) hairpin sequence (Klug SJ et al., 1997, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:6676-6681). In four selection cycles an enriched pool of tight SelB-binding aptamers was obtained; sequencing revealed that all aptamers were different in their primary sequence and most bore no recognizable consensus to known RNA motifs. Domain mapping for SelB-binding aptamers showed that despite the different RNA-binding sites in the protein, the vast majority of aptamers bound to the ultimate C-terminus of SelB, the domain responsible for mRNA hairpin binding."

To provide new insights into the biochemical and pathological mechanisms of EPM1, we are working toward developing an animal model for this disease. Here we present the mouse cystatin B nucleotide and amino acid sequence. We show that the mouse gene spans a 3-kb genomic region and contains 3 exons and 2 introns, identical to the structure of both the rat and human cystatin B genes. The amino acid sequence identity of the protein is 86%, 79%, and 71% to that of the rat, human, and bovine cystatin B proteins, respectively. In addition, we show that the mouse cystatin B gene is expressed in many tissues, similar to results observed previously in humans. Finally, we report the mapping of the mouse cystatin B gene (Stfb) to chromosome 10, further extending the synteny between this region of the mouse chromosome and human chromosome 21q22.3."
Two phases in the addition of a poly(A) tail.,Genes & Development,Genes Dev.,0890-9369,1549-5477,10.1101/gad.3.9.1401,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/3/9/1401,3,9,09/01/1989,1401,1412,"['M D Sheets', 'M Wickens']","['Cell and Molecular Biology Program, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706.']","The addition of a poly(A) tail has been examined in a HeLa cell nuclear extract using SV40 late RNAs that end at or near the natural poly(A) site. We find that the addition of a full-length, 200-nucleotide poly(A) tail occurs in two discrete phases. In the first phase, the addition of each adenosine is dependent on the highly conserved sequence AAUAAA. Mutations in that sequence result in an accumulation of products that contain 9 or fewer adenosine residues. In the second phase, poly(A) addition no longer requires AAUAAA but, instead, requires the oligo(A) primer synthesized during the first phase. Thus, RNAs carrying an AAUAAA mutation and a 3'-terminal oligo(A) segment are extended efficiently to full-length poly(A). The transition between phases occurs with the addition of the tenth adenosine residue. An activity exists that limits the length of poly(A) added in the extract to approximately 200 nucleotides. The two phases share at least one component and are likely to involve the same poly(A) polymerase."

Whereas the field of bioelectronic medicine has mainly focused on the stimulation of neural circuits to treat various conditions, recent studies have started to investigate the possibility of leveraging the sensory arm of these reflexes to diagnose disease states. To accomplish this, neural signals emanating from the body's built-in biosensors and propagating through peripheral nerves must be recorded and decoded to identify the presence or levels of relevant biomarkers of disease. The process of acquiring these signals poses several technical challenges related to the neural interfaces, surgical techniques, and data-processing framework needed to record and analyze them. However, these challenges can be addressed with a rigorous experimental approach and new advances in implantable electrodes, signal processing, and machine learning methods. Outlined in this review are studies decoding vagus nerve activity as it related to inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiopulmonary biomarkers. Successfully decoding peripheral nerve activity related to disease states will not only enable the development of real-time diagnostic devices, but also help advancing truly closed-loop neuromodulation technologies."
Utilization of FISH in positional cloning: an example on 13q22.,Genome Research,Genome Res.,1088-9051,1549-5469,10.1101/gr.6.10.1002,https://genome.cshlp.org/content/6/10/1002,6,10,10/01/1996,1002,1012,"['M Laan', 'J Isosomppi', 'T Klockars', 'L Peltonen', 'A Palotie']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Finland.']","In positional cloning the initial assignment of a gene to a specific chromosomal locus is followed by physical mapping of the critical region. The construction of a high-resolution physical map still involves considerable effort. However, new high-resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques have facilitated this process substantially. Here we summarize a strategy that combines a spectrum of FISH techniques [metaphase, interphase, mechanically stretched chromosomes (MSCs), and fiber-FISH on free chromatin] for the construction and characterization of a high-resolution physical map for a positional cloning project. The chromosomal region 13q22, containing the locus of the variant form of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (vLINCL, CLN5) disease, serves here as an example for this process. We used metaphase FISH to exclude positionally a candidate gene, to refine the locus to 13q22, and to analyze the possible chimerism of the YACs in the region. Both metaphase and interphase FISH techniques were applied to determine the low-resolution distances between the restricting markers. FISH using MSCs confirmed the centromeric-telomeric order of the clones and facilitated the estimation of the size of the gaps between the clones. Finally, fiber-FISH was found to be the method of choice for the construction of an accurate high-resolution map of the contig established over the restricted region. Thus, FISH techniques in combination with genetic mapping data enabled the refinement of the initial 4-cM region to a high-resolution map of only 400 kb in length. Here the FISH strategy replaced the need for many laborious traditional physical mapping methods, e.g., pulsed-field gel electrophoresis."

Here, we provide a protocol to study the intracellular dynamics of mitochondria in the wing neurons of adult Drosophila in situ. The mounting and imaging procedures that we describe are suitable for use on most microscopes, and they can be easily implemented in any laboratory. Our noninvasive mounting procedures, combined with the translucency of the wing cuticle in adult animals, makes the wing nervous system accessible to advanced microscopy studies in a physiological environment. Combining the powerful genetics of Drosophila with time-lapse live imaging, users of this protocol will be able to analyze mitochondrial dynamics over time in a subset of sensory neurons in the wing. These cells extend long axons with a stereotypical plus-end-out microtubule orientation that represents a unique model to understand the logic of neuronal cargo transport, including the mitochondria. Finally, the neurons in this tissue respond to mechanical and chemical stimulation of the sensory organs of the wing, opening up the possibility of coupling the study of mitochondrial dynamics with the modulation of neuronal activity in aging Drosophila . We anticipate that the unique characteristics of this in vivo system will contribute to the discovery of novel mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial dynamics within an organismal context with relevant implications for the pathogenesis of age-dependent neurological disorders."
"Single-unit evidence for eye-blink conditioning in cerebellar cortex is altered, but not eliminated, by interpositus nucleus lesions.",Learning & Memory,Learn.

Empirical evidence, however, does not always appear to be consistent with such formulations. It is the anterior cerebellar interpositus nucleus (aINP) that seems to be essential for acquisition and retention of conditioned eye-blink responses under most circumstances and it has been therefore suggested that the aINP is the critical site of learning-related plasticity during eye-blink conditioning. Supporting this conclusion are studies demonstrating that multiple-unit conditioning-related neural activity patterns observed in many brain regions disappear after aINP lesion. The possibility that the cerebellar cortex may be involved in forming these patterns has not been assessed adequately, however. In the current study, trained rabbits received kainic acid lesions of the INP. After recovery, the animals underwent additional sessions of conditioning during which single-unit activity was recorded from the cerebellar cortex. Our results suggest that the aINP is not the sole site of plasticity during eye-blink conditioning, as a subset of the neurons recorded from lesioned animals demonstrated conditioning-related firing patterns. The lesions did change the character of these firing patterns from those observed in saline controls, however, in ways that can be generally described as a loss of organization. The normal tendency for the population of cortical cells to change firing rate together, for instance, was significantly less noticeable in lesioned animals. These results suggest that the aINP may be involved in the production of important features of conditioned responding, such as system timing function, therefore suggesting the need for more models that incorporate aINP and brain stem feedback as integral to the production of organized neural and behavioral responses."

Because all class 1 RFs promote a stop-codon-dependent and ribosome-dependent hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNAs, one may anticipate that this common function relies on a common structural motif(s). We have compared amino acid sequences of the available class 1 RFs and found a novel, common, unique, and strictly conserved GGQ motif that should be in a loop (coil) conformation as deduced by programs predicting protein secondary structure. Site-directed mutagenesis of the human eRF1 as a representative of class 1 RFs shows that substitution of both glycyl residues in this motif, G183 and G184, causes complete inactivation of the protein as a release factor toward all three stop codons, whereas two adjacent amino acid residues, G181 and R182, are functionally nonessential. Inactive human eRF1 mutants compete in release assays with wild-type eRF1 and strongly inhibit their release activity. Mutations of the glycyl residues in this motif do not affect another function, the ability of eRF1 together with the ribosome to induce GTPase activity of human eRF3, a class 2 RF. We assume that the novel highly conserved GGQ motif is implicated directly or indirectly in the activity of class 1 RFs in translation termination."

Selection studies were conducted on the P4-P6 domain from the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron, an autonomous self-folding unit that contains several important tertiary folding motifs including the tetraloop receptor and the A-rich bulge. Partially randomized P4-P6 molecules were selected based on their ability to fold into compact structures using native gel electrophoresis in the presence of decreasing concentrations of MgCl2. After 10 rounds of the selection process, a number of sequence alterations were identified that stabilized the P4-P6 RNA. One of these, a single base deletion of C209 within the P4 helix, significantly stabilized the P4-P6 molecule and would not have been identified by an activity-based selection because of its essential role for ribozyme function. Additionally, the sequence analysis provided evidence that stabilization of secondary structure may contribute to overall tertiary stability for RNAs. This system for probing RNA structure irrespective of RNA activity allows analysis of RNA structure/function relationships by identifying nucleotides or motifs important for folding and then comparing them with RNA sequences required for function."

Using an efficient variant of the fluorescent-PCR technology, we can monitor transcription semiquantitatively. The ability to detect all amplifications and deletions at any single copy locus by PCR makes this the technique of choice to assay genomic sequence copy number anomalies in birth defects and cancers.

We have used a truncated EnvZ protein (EnvZ115), which is defective in sensory function but able to communicate with OmpR, to study the biochemical interactions between these two proteins and their effects on transcription from the ompF promoter. We show that purified EnvZ115 can phosphorylate OmpR in the presence of ATP. In addition, EnvZ115 stimulates the ability of OmpR to activate ompF transcription in vitro. Using antibodies specific for EnvZ, we have purified the wild-type protein and have shown that it is also an OmpR kinase.

The earliest acting regulatory gene so far identified in the mother-cell line of gene expression is spoIIID, whose product is required for the transcription of the composite gene (sigK) encoding the mother-cell RNA polymerase sigma-factor sigma K and for the chromosomal rearrangement that gives rise to the composite gene. Here we report the nucleotide sequence of spoIIID and studies on the temporal, spatial, and genetic control of its expression during sporulation. We show that the deduced spoIIID gene product, a 93-residue-long polypeptide, is a previously identified transcription factor that is known to activate the promoter for the sigK gene in vitro. Expression of spoIIID is largely confined to the mother-cell chamber of the sporangium and is turned on at, or shortly before, the time (hour 3 of sporulation) that the mother-cell chromosome is rearranged and transcription of the sigK gene commences. This gene expression depends strongly on the sporulation sigma-factor sigma E and partially on the spoIIID gene product, itself. We conclude that the timing and compartmentalization of the rearrangement and transcription of the sigK gene and, hence, of subsequent gene activation in the mother cell, are, in part, direct consequences of the temporal and spatial control of spoIIID gene expression."
